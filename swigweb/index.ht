Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator

<h2>Welcome to SWIG</h2>

[ <a href="http://swig-jp.dyndns.org">Japanese</a> ]

<p>
SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in
C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming
languages.  SWIG is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as
Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk and Ruby. The list of 
<a href="compat.html#SupportedLanguages">supported languages</a> also includes 
non-scripting languages such as C#, Common Lisp (Allegro CL), Java, Modula-3 and OCAML. Also several
interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (Chicken, Guile, MzScheme)
are supported. SWIG is most
commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming
environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++
software.  SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and
Lisp s-expressions.  SWIG may be freely used, distributed, and modified for commercial
and non-commercial use.
