SWIG FAQ

<p>

<p>
To date, there has been no FAQ for SWIG.   As a result, you may want to 
check the following locations:

<ul>
<li>The <a href="doc.html">online documentation</a>.
<li>The <a href="bugs.html">bug tracking database</a>.
<li>The <a href="mail.html">Mailing list archive</a>.
</ul>

At this time, I am looking into the creation of a FAQ.  However, this would be
much much easier if there were a volunteer to help.
