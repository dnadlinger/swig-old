Just the facts:

<ul>
<li>July, 1995. Dave develops SWIG while working in the Theoretical
Physics Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Originally, it
was conceived as an extension building tool for a customized scripting
language that had been created for the Connection Machine 5.

<li>January, 1996. SWIG rewritten in C++ at the University of Utah and expanded to cover Tcl, Perl, and Guile.

<li>February, 1996. First alpha release.

<li>September, 1996. Version 1.0 released.  Support for Python added.

<li>September, 1997. Version 1.1 released with a variety of improvements such as shadow classes.

<li>February, 1998. SWIG1.1p5 released.

<li>1997-1999.  Various unsuccessful attempts to create SWIG2.0.
