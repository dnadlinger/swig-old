Runtime Libraries
-----------------

The SWIG runtime libraries are built in this directory.

Unix
----
Run make. This can also be done from the top level directory by running
'make runtime' and is automatically done when building the swig executable.

Windows
-------
See Doc\Manual\Windows.html for environment variables to set and further information.
Choose which runtime library needs building and load the Visual Studio 6
project file and build it. For example, use swigpy.dsp for Python.
