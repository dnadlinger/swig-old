/*************************************************************************
 * Type initialization:
 * This problem is tough by the requirement that no dynamic 
 * memory is used. Also, since swig_type_info structures store pointers to 
 * swig_cast_info structures and swig_cast_info structures store pointers back
 * to swig_type_info structures, we need some lookup code at initialization. 
 * The idea is that swig generates all the structures that are needed. 
 * The runtime then collects these partially filled structures. 
 * The SWIG_InitializeModule function takes these initial arrays out of 
 * swig_module, and does all the lookup, filling in the swig_module.types
 * array with the correct data and linking the correct swig_cast_info
 * structures together.

 * The generated swig_type_info structures are assigned staticly to an initial 
 * array. We just loop though that array, and handle each type individually.
 * First we lookup if this type has been already loaded, and if so, use the
 * loaded structure instead of the generated one. Then we have to fill in the
 * cast linked list. The cast data is initially stored in something like a
 * two-dimensional array. Each row corresponds to a type (there are the same
 * number of rows as there are in the swig_type_initial array). Each entry in
 * a column is one of the swig_cast_info structures for that type.
 * The cast_initial array is actually an array of arrays, because each row has
 * a variable number of columns. So to actually build the cast linked list,
 * we find the array of casts associated with the type, and loop through it 
 * adding the casts to the list. The one last trick we need to do is making
 * sure the type pointer in the swig_cast_info struct is correct.

 * First off, we lookup the cast->type name to see if it is already loaded. 
 * There are three cases to handle:
 *  1) If the cast->type has already been loaded AND the type we are adding
 *     casting info to has not been loaded (it is in this module), THEN we
 *     replace the cast->type pointer with the type pointer that has already
 *     been loaded.
 *  2) If BOTH types (the one we are adding casting info to, and the 
 *     cast->type) are loaded, THEN the cast info has already been loaded by
 *     the previous module so we just ignore it.
 *  3) Finally, if cast->type has not already been loaded, then we add that
 *     swig_cast_info to the linked list (because the cast->type) pointer will
 *     be correct.
