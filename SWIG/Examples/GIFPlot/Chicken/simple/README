This is a very minimalistic example in which just a few functions
and constants from library are wrapped and used to draw some simple
shapes.  

`make' will build a version of the CHICKEN interpreter which defines
an additional unit (simple).  Run `./simple test-simple.scm' to test
it.

** If you have a platform that supports dynamic linking (most UNIXes
** and Win32), then you can run "make module".  This will create a
** dynamic module called module.dll/module.so/module.shl (depending on
** your platform), which you can use with the following:

   (load-library 'precsi "module.dll")

or

   (load-library 'simple "module.dll")
