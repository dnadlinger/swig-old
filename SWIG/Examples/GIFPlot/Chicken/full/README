This example runs the entire gifplot.h header file through SWIG without
any changes.  The Scheme program 'test-gifplot.scm' does something a 
little more interesting.  You'll have to go look at the header file to
get a complete listing of the functions.

`make' will build a version of the CHICKEN interpreter which defines
an additional unit (gifplot).  Run `./simple test-gifplot.scm' to test
it.

** If you have a platform that supports dynamic linking (most UNIXes
** and Win32), then you can run "make module".  This will create a
** dynamic module called module.dll/module.so/module.shl (depending on
** your platform), which you can use with the following:

   (load-library 'precsi "module.dll")

or

   (load-library 'gifplot "module.dll")
