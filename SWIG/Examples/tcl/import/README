This example tests the SWIG run-time libraries and use of the
%import directive to work with multiple modules.

Use 'tclsh runme.tcl' to run a test.

Overview:
---------

The example defines 4 different extension modules--each wrapping
a separate C++ class.

     base.i     -  Base class
     foo.i      -  Foo class derived from Base
     bar.i      -  Bar class derived from Base
     spam.i     -  Spam class derived from Bar

Each module used %import to refer to another module.  For
example, the 'foo.i' module uses '%import base.i' to get
definitions for its base class. 

If everything is working correctly, all of the modules will load
correctly and type checking will work correctly.   The
example requires the use of the SWIG run-time libraries
which must be built and properly installed.
