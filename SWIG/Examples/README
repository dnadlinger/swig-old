SWIG Examples

The "perl5", "python", "tcl", "guile", "java", "mzscheme", and "ruby"
directories contain a number of simple examples that are primarily
used for testing. The "GIFPlot" directory contains a more complicated
example that illustrates some of SWIG's more advanced capabilities.

The file 'index.html' is the top of a hyperlinked document that
contains information about all of the examples along with various
notes related to each example.

The Examples directory is currently quite incomplete because it
is being reorganized.  A more complete set of examples can be found
in the SWIG1.1p5 distribution (most of which should still work with 
SWIG1.3).

Note: All of the examples rely upon the Makefile in this directory.
You may need to edit it to reflect the configuration of your machine
in case the configure script guesses incorrect settings.

*** Special note concering C++ ***

The configure script is currently unable to handle all of the possible
options for producing dynamically loadable C++ extensions.  Here are
the rules of thumb for making C++ work:

 -  Try using the C++ as the linker for the shared library.  For example:

         g++ -shared $(OBJS) -o module.so

 -  If that doesn't work, you may need to explicitly link against some
    kind of C++ runtime library.  For example:

         ld -G $(OBJS) -L/opt/SUNWspro/lib -lCrun -o module.so

    This can be set by modifying the setting of CPP_DLLIBS in the
    Makefile.

 -  RTM (sorry)
