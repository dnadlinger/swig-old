SWIG Examples

The "perl5", "python", "tcl", "guile", "java", and "mzscheme"
directories contain a very simple example.  The "GIFPlot" contains a
more complicated example that illustrates some of SWIG's more advanced
capabilities.

The Examples directory is currently quite incomplete because it
is being reorganized.  A more complete set of examples can be found
in the SWIG1.1p5 distribution (most of which should work with 
SWIG1.3).

Note: Most of the examples rely upon the Makefile in this directory.
You may need to edit it to reflect the configuration of your machine
in case the configure script guesses incorrectly.
