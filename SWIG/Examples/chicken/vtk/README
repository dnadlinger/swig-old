Wrappers for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).

VTK must be installed first.

VTK Installation Instructions
-----------------------------

Warning to GCC users:

GCC version 3 cannot be used to compile VTK; you may check the version
of gcc with "gcc -version".  GCC version 3 is the default compiler on
recent cygwin systems, and is used on some other newer systems as
well.  Be sure that you have another compiler or GCC version 2 on your
system (for example, the package "gcc2" on cygwin).  You will specify
your other compiler on *ALL* commands that start with "make".  For
example, if you have the "gcc2" package on cygwin, when you get to the
following VTK build instruction:

	make VTKVER=40 vtkcygwin

use instead:

	make VTKVER=40 CC="gcc-2" CXX="c++-2" LDSHARED="gcc-2 -shared" CXXSHARED="c++-2 -shared" vtkcygwin

On non-cygwin system, the VTK build instruction:

	make VTKVER=40 vtkunix

would be replaced by:

	make VTKVER=40 CC="<path to non-gcc3 C compiler>" CXX="<path to non-gcc3 C++ compiler>" LDSHARED="<path to non-gcc3 C shared linker>" CXXSHARED="<path to non-gcc3 C++ shared linker>" vtkunix

and so on ...

GENERAL NOTE: At this moment, Common/vtkViewport.o is not included in
libCommon.a for VTK 4.0.  This causes problems and is an obvious
mistake.  So the Makefile looks for vtkViewport.o in the
vtk40/VTK/Common directory when building this SWIG example.  So only
Method 3 is an option right now (or Method 2 if you copy vtkViewport.o
to .../chicken/vtk/vtk40/VTK/Common/).


-- Method 1 (Win32 with mingw) --

Download vtk40Core.exe and vtkCpp.exe from
http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php.

Run vtk40Core.exe and install to wherever (I will assume you
installed to the default "C:\Program Files\vtk4.0").

Run vtkCpp.exe and install to the same directory you install
vtk40Core.

Before building this SWIG example, set
VTKHOME=C:\Program Files\vtk4.0

and then run "make" in this chicken/vtk directory using Mingw32 (that
is, run Cygwin shell, and set the PATH to .../mingw/bin).

-- Method 2 --

Download a source archive (either vtk40Src.zip or vtk40Src.tar.gz)
from http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php and follow the
instructions using "README.html" (which is inside vtk40Src).

-- Method 3 (Unix or Cygwin) --

If you do not have "cmake" installed on your system, do the following
and it will be installed in chicken/vtk/cmakelocal:

	Download 

	cmake-1.6.2.tar.gz from
	http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

	and place it in this chicken/vtk directory.

	Type:
		make CMAKEVER=cmake-1.6.2 cmake
		PATH=${PWD}/cmakelocal/bin:$PATH
		export PATH

If you do not have "vtk" installed on your system, do the following
and it will be installed in chicken/vtk/vtklocal:

	Download

	vtk40Src.tar.gz from
	http://public.kitware.com/VTK/get-software.php 

	and place it in this chicken/vtk directory.

	Type (for cygwin):
		make VTKVER=40 vtkcygwin

	(for everyone else):
		make VTKVER=40 vtkunix

VTK SWIG Example
----------------

Make sure that VTK is installed.  If you followed the previous
instructions, then VTK will be installed in .../chicken/vtk/vtklocal.
The following instructions will assume ${PWD}/vtklocal; if you
installed VTK elsewhere, use the correct installation path
(ie. /usr/local instead of ${PWD}/vtklocal).

First, test to make sure VTK is working ...

	cygwin:
		make EXTRALIBS="-lgdi32 -lopengl32" VTKHOME=${PWD}/vtklocal c
		./c-sphere.exe
		./c-quadric.exe

	other Unixes:
		make EXTRALIBS="-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lGL -lGLU -lGLw" VTKHOME=${PWD}/vtklocal c
		./c-sphere
		./c-quadric


You should see a blue sphere that you can manipulate with the mouse
buttons.

Second, test to make sure the SWIG wrappers can be generated and work
for VTK ...

	cygwin:
		make EXTRALIBS="-lgdi32 -lopengl32" VTKHOME=${PWD}/vtklocal
		./vtk test-vtk-sphere.scm
		./vtk test-vtk-quadric.scm

	other Unixes:
		make EXTRALIBS="-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lGL -lGLU -lGLw" VTKHOME=${PWD}/vtklocal
		./vtk test-vtk-sphere.scm
		./vtk test-vtk-quadric.scm
