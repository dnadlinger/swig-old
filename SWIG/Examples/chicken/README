This directory contains examples for CHICKEN.

class       -- illustrates the shadow-class C++ interface
constants   -- handling #define and %constant literals
multimap    -- typemaps with multiple sub-types
overload    -- C++ function overloading
simple      -- the simple example from the user manual
zlib        -- a wrapping of the zlib compression library

Note that the examples in this directory build a special version of
the CHICKEN interpreter (statically linked) which includes the wrapped
functions in the top-level module.  Just run "make" in any example
directory.

** If you have a platform that supports dynamic linking (most UNIXes
** and Win32), then you can run "make module" in any example
** directory.  This will create a dynamic module called
** module.dll/module.so/module.shl (depending on your platform), which
** you can use with the following:

   (load-library 'precsi "module.dll")

or

   (load-library 'example "module.dll")
