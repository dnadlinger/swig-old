This directory contains examples for CHICKEN.

class       -- illustrates the shadow-class C++ interface
constants   -- handling #define and %constant literals
multimap    -- typemaps with multiple sub-types
overload    -- C++ function overloading
simple      -- the simple example from the user manual
vtk         -- a full-blown wrapping of the Visualization Toolkit

Note that the examples in this directory build a special version of
CHICKEN which includes the wrapped functions in the top-level module.

If you want to put the wrapped functions into your own module,
statically or dynamically linked, see the Examples/GIFPlot/Chicken
directory.
