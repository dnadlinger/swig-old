<H2>SWIG wrapped and manually wrapped functions in Java</H2>

<tt>$Header$</tt><br>

<p>
This example compares wrapping a c global function using the manual way and the SWIG way.

<ul>
<li><a href="example.i">example.i</a>. Interface file comparing code wrapped by SWIG and wrapped manually. 
<li><a href="main.java">main.java</a>. Sample Java program showing calls to both manually wrapped and SWIG wrapped c functions.
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>SWIG writes all the awkward JNI code for you. You just have to tell SWIG which functions to wrap.
<li>If memory is allocated in c it needs to be free'd. A function, such as free(), can be provided with access from Java to free the memory.
</ul>
