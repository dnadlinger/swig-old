Version 1.3.25 (In progress)
============================

Dec/15: mmatus
	- More fixes for templates and template default args.
	  See template_default.i for scary cases that now are 
	  supported, besides the already ugly STL/std cases.
	  
	- Cosmetics and more use of 'const' where it was implicit.
	- Other fixes for OSS, which is now working again with 1.3.25.
