Version 1.3.29 (In progress)
============================

02/13/2006: mgossage
            [Documents] updated the extending documents to give a skeleton swigging code
            with a few typemaps.
            [Lua] added an extra typemap for void* [in], so a function which requires a void*
            can take any kind of pointer
