Version 1.3.25 (In progress)
============================

03/31/2005: wsfulton
            Turned on extra template features previously only available to Python.
            This enables typemaps defined within a templated class to be used as
            expected. Requires %template on the templated class, %template() will
            also pick up the typemaps. Example:

              template <typename T> struct Foo {
                ...
                %typemap(in) Foo "in typemap for Foo<T> "
                or
                %typemap(in) Foo<T> "in typemap for Foo<T> "
              };
              
              %template(Foo_i) Foo<int>;
              %template() Foo<double>;
              
            will generate the proper 'in' typemaps wherever Foo<int> and Foo<double>
            are used.

03/30/2005: mkoeppe (Matthias Koeppe)
	    [MzScheme] Patch from Hans Oesterholt for supporting MzScheme 30x.

03/29/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    [Chicken]
	    + Reallow older versions of chicken (1.40 to 1.89) by passing -nocollection
	      argument to SWIG
	    + %import now works correctly with tinyclos.  (declare (uses ...)) will be
	      exported correctly.
	    + TinyCLOS proxy classes now work correctly with overloaded functions
	      and constructors.

03/29/2005: wsfulton
            [Java] Patch from Scott Michel for directorout typemaps. Java directors
            require the directorout typemaps like the other languages now. The new
            typemaps provide fixes for methods where the return type is returned
            by reference (this cannot automatically be made thread safe though).

03/22/2005: wsfulton
            Enum casting fixes. Visual C++ didn't like the C type casting SWIG produced
            when wrapping C++ enum references, as reported by Admire Kandawasvika.

03/21/2005: wsfulton
            [Perl] SF #1124490. Fix Perl macro clashes when using Visual Studio's STL string,
            so now projects can #include <string>.

03/21/2005: wsfulton
            Fixed %varargs which got broken with the recent default argument changes.
            Also works for Java and C# for the first time now.

03/17/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            [Chicken] 
	    + Fix a whole bunch of bugs in the chicken module.  The entire
              test suite now compiles, with the exception of the tests that require
	      std_vector.i, std_deque.i, and so on, which chicken does not have yet.

	    + Add support for %exception and %typemap(exceptions).  Exceptions are
	      thrown with a call to (abort) and can be handled by (handle-exceptions)

03/15/2005: wsfulton
            [Java] Patch from Scott Michel for directors. Modifications to the typemaps
            giving users fine control over memory ownership and lifetime of director classes.
            Director classes no longer live forever by default as they are now collectable
            by the GC.

03/15/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    [Chicken] Add support for adding finalizers garbage collected objects.
	    Functions that return new objects should be marked with %newobject and
	    input arguments which consume (or take ownership) of a pointer should
	    be marked with the DISOWN typemap.

	    Also add support for correctly checking the number of arguments passed
	    to a function, and raising an error if the wrong number are passed.

03/14/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            Add --without-alllang option to configure.in, which is the same as
            passing all the --without-python --without-perl5 etc... that Matthias added.

03/09/2005: wsfulton
            [Php] Memory leak fix for functions returning classes/structs by value.

03/08/2005: wsfulton
            [Perl] Fix for Perl incorrectly taking memory ownership for return types that
            are typedefs to a struct/class pointer. Reported by Josh Cherry.

03/07/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] Various exception changes for the std::vector wrappers. These now more
            accurately mirror the same exceptions that System.Collections.ArrayList throw.

03/07/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] Fix undefined behaviour after any of the std::vector methods
            throw an exception.

03/07/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] When null is passed for a C++ reference or value parameter, the 
            exception thrown has been corrected to an ArgumentNullException instead
            of NullReferenceException as recommended in the .NET Framework documentation.

            The default throws typemaps turn a C++ exception into an ApplicationException,
            not a SystemException now.

03/07/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] Numerous changes in C# exception handling have been made over the past
            few weeks. A summary follows:

            The way in which C++ exceptions are mapped to C# exceptions is quite different.
            The change is to fix C# exceptions so that the C++ exception stack is correctly
            unwound as previously C++ exceptions were being thrown across the C PInvoke layer
            into the managed world.

            New typemap attributes (canthrow and excode) have been introduced to control the
            mapping of C++ to C# exceptions. Essentially a callback into the unmanaged world
            is made to set a pending exception. The exception to throw is stored in thread local
            storage (so the approach is thread-safe). The typemaps are expected to return
            from unmanaged code as soon as the pending exception is set. Any pending exceptions
            are checked for and thrown once managed code starts executing. There should
            be minimal impact on execution speed during normal behaviour. Full details will be
            documented in CSharp.html.

            The SWIG_CSharpThrowException() function has been removed and replaced with the
            SWIG_CSharpSetPendingExceptionArgument() and SWIG_CSharpSetPendingException()
            functions. The original name has been deliberately changed to break old code as
            the old approach was somewhat flawed. Any user defined exceptions that follow the
            same pattern as the old approach should also be fixed.

            Numerous new .NET framework exceptions are now available for easy throwing from 
            unmanaged code. The complete list is: 

              ApplicationException, ArithmeticException, DivideByZeroException, 
              IndexOutOfRangeException, InvalidOperationException, IOException, 
              NullReferenceException, OutOfMemoryException, OverflowException, 
              SystemException, ArgumentException, ArgumentNullException and
              ArgumentOutOfRangeException.

05/05/2005: mmatus
	    
	    Fix several memory leaks around. Even when we survive  knowning
	    swig is a memory leak factory, it was a little out of
	    control. To run std_containers.i in the python test-suite,
	    swig was using ~260MB, now it uses 'only' ~40MB, which is
	    the same ammount that g++ uses, so, is not that bad.
	    In the process, I found a couple of extra Deletes, which
	    in some cases could trigger seg. faults and/or
	    DOH/asserts.
	    
	    [python] Better support for directors + exception. More
	    verbose errors and added an unexpected exception handler.

	    [python] Fix memory leak for the

	    	    std::vector<std::vector<int> > 

	    case,reported by Bo Peng.

	    [python] Fix SwigPyObject compare problem reporte by
	    Cameron Patrick. 

	    [python] Fix several warnings in the generated code 
	    for gnu-gcc, Intel and VC7.1  compilers.


02/25/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    Update documentation to use CSS and <div> instead of <blockquote>
	    I used a script to convert the docs, and it set all the box classes
	    to be "code".  There are actually 4 different classes,
	    "shell", "code", "targetlang", and "diagram".  We need to go through
	    and convert the divs depending on what they contain.

02/23/2005: mmatus

	    [Python] Added option -nortti to disable the use of native
	    C++ RTTI with directors (dynamic_cast<> is not used).

	    Add more code for directors to detect and report errors in
	    the python side.

	    Extend the use of SWIGINTERN whenever is possible.

	    Remove template warnings reported by VC7.1.

	    Remove warnings reported by gcc/g++. Finally you can
	    compile using

	       g++ -W -Wall -c mymodule_wrap.cxx

	    and no spurious errors will be generated in the wrapper
	    code.

02/23/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    Added -external-runtime argument.  This argument is used to dump
	    out all the code needed for external access to the runtime system,
	    and it replaces including the files directly.  This change adds
	    two new virtual functions to the Language class, which are used
	    to find the language specific runtime code.  I also updated
	    all languages that use the runtime to implement these two functions.

02/22/2005: mmatus 
	    Fix %template + private error SF#1099976.

02/21/2005: mmatus 

	    Fix swigrun.swg warnings reported when using "gcc -W -Wall"
	    (static/inline not used in front of a function
	    declaration), and add SWIGUNUSED attribute to avoid
	    unused warnings elsewhere.

	    Fix unused variable warnings.

	    [Python] Use new SWIGUNUSED attribute to avoid warnings in
	    SWIGINTERN methods.

	    [Python] Fix PyOS_snprintf for python versions < 2.2 (SF #1104919).

	    [Python] Fix map/multimap to allow empty maps (reported by
  	    Philippe Hetroy).

	    [Docs] Add some documentation to Python.html and
	    SWIGPlus.html, including for example the fact that
	    'friends' are now supported.

02/21/2005: wsfulton
            [PHP] Patch from Olly Betts, so that wrappers compile with Zend thread safety enabled.

02/17/2005: wsfulton
            Memory leak fix in some of the scripting language modules when using default
            arguments in constructors. The scripting language was not taking ownership of the
            C++ object memory when any of the constructors that use default arguments was called.

02/16/2005: wsfulton
            SF #1115055: Failed make install. Patch from Rob Stone.

02/16/2005: wsfulton
            [Java] SF #1123416 from Paul Moore. Correct memory allocation for STRINGARRAY
            typemaps in various.i.

02/15/2005: wsfulton
            Disabled typemap search changes for now (see entry 19/12/2004). It breaks
            old typemaps, lengthens the execution time by about 25% and introduces
            inconsistencies.

02/15/2005: wsfulton
            swig -help follows other software by printing to stdout instead of stderr now.
            swig -version also displays to stdout instead of stderr now.
            Behaviour reported by Torsten Landschoff.

02/15/2005: wsfulton
            [Ruby] Fix for the less commonly used ordering of %include and #include, so
            that the generated code compiles. Bug reported by reported by Max Bowsher.
              %include foo.h
              %{
              #include foo.h
              %} 

02/15/2005: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] SWIG_exception macro will now return from unmanaged code / native code
            as soon as it is called. Fixes possible JVM crashes and other code unexpectedly
            being executed. Note SWIG_exception is only occasionally used by SWIG library
            writers, and is best avoided by SWIG users.

02/15/2005: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] Typemaps can now be targeted at global variable names
            and static member variable names. Previously the typemaps for 
            the setters were ignored, for example:

              %typemap(in) int globalint "..."
              int globalint;

02/13/2005: mkoeppe (Matthias Koeppe)
	    [Guile] Add %typecheck for SWIGTYPE, add %typecheck for ptrdiff_t, fix
	    typemaps for size_t.

	    [Pike] Merge patch from Torsten Landschoff for improved Pike configuration.

02/12/2005: mkoeppe (Matthias Koeppe)
	    New configure switches --without-tcl, --without-python etc. allow to
            disable the search for installed languages.

01/31/2005: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
            - Add DohSortList to DOH
	    
	    - Improve the runtime type system:
               + Speed. Type loading is now O(n log n) instead of O(N^2), which
	         for large modules is a huge improvement.
               + A whole bunch of functions in swigrun.swg no longer need the 
                 swig_type_list_handle passed to them.  The only one left is 
		 TypeQuery.  This also makes runtime.swg a lot smaller.
	       + Split up swig_type_info structure into two structures
	         (swig_type_info and swig_cast_info)
	       + Store a pointer to a swig_type_info rather than just the type
	         name string in the linked list of casts. First off, this makes
	         the guile module a little faster, and second, the
	         SWIG_TypeClientData() function is faster too. 
	       + Add the idea of a module into the type system.  Before, all the
	         types were stored in one huge linked list. Now, another level is
	         added, and the type system stores a linked list of modules, each
	         of which stores an array of types associated with it.
	       + For more information of how the runtime type system now works,
	         please see Doc/Manual/typemaps.html and Doc/Devel/runtime.txt
		 
	    - Update all language modules to use the new type system.  The changes
	      to each language module are minor.  All languages are now able to
	      use runtime.swg for external access to the type system.  Before
	      only python and perl did.

	    - [guile, mzscheme, ocaml, and php4]  These languages opened up the
	      init function inside the .cxx code, and any code in the .swg files
	      in the init section was inside this function.  This was a problem
	      for swiginit.swg, which needs to be inserted before the SWIG_init
	      function is opened.  Thus I changed these languages to be like
	      python or perl, where the init function is declared in the .swg
	      file.
	      
	    - [Ruby] Instead of moving the init function to the .swg file, I
	      added a new section initbeforefunc, and then added
	      %insert(initbeforefunc) "swiginit.swg"

	    - [MzScheme] Fix enums and fix Examples/Makefile.in so that if
	      multiple -I arguments are specified in the INCLUDES variable, each
	      gets a ++ccf.

	    - [Guile GH] Update Guile GH to use the new type system.  See
	      Doc/Manual/Guile.html for how smobs are now used.

01/11/2005: wsfulton
            [C#] New typemap called 'csconstruct'. The code in this typemaps was previously hard
            coded and could not be customised by a user. This typemap contains the code that is
            generated into a proxy class's constructor.

            [Java] New typemap called 'javaconstruct'. The code in this typemaps was previously hard
            coded and could not be customised by a user. This typemap contains the code that is
            generated into a proxy class's constructor. Another typemap named 'javaconstruct_director'
            is used instead when the proxy class is a director class.

            [C#, Java] If a C++ class did not have a default constructor, a protected default constructor
            was automatically generated by SWIG. This seems is unnecessary and has been removed
            and thereby giving the user almost complete control over the generated code along with the
            new typemaps above.

19/12/2004: mmatus
            [Disabled, see entry 02/15/2004]
            - Fix typemap search, now the "out" typemap search is done as follows

                 int *Foo::foo(int bar)   ->  int *Foo::foo(int bar)
                                          ->  int *Foo::foo
                                          ->  int *foo(int bar)
                                          ->  int *foo
                                          ->  int *

               then, now you can be more specific, and define

              /* apply only for  'Foo::foo' method */
              %typemap(out) int * Foo::foo(int *bar) ...; 

              /* apply for all 'foo' functions/methods */
              %typemap(out) int * foo(int *bar) ...; 

              %inline {
                struct Foo {
                   int *foo(int *bar);
                };
              }
	  

15/12/2004: mmatus
            - More fixes for templates and template default args.
              See template_default.i for scary cases that now are 
              supported, besides the already ugly STL/std cases.
              
            - Cosmetics and more use of 'const' where it was implicit.
            - Other fixes for OSS, which is now working again with 1.3.25.
