Version 1.3.30 (in progress)
============================

05/03/2006: wsfulton
            Modify typemaps so that char * can be applied to unsigned char * or signed char *
            types and visa versa.

             - a struct/enum/union is replaced with :pointer only if
               that slot is actually a pointer to that type. So,: 
                    struct a_struct { int x; } and
                    struct b_struct { a_struct struct_1; }; 
               will be converted as:
                   (cffi:defcstruct b_struct
                           (struct_1 a_struct))
             - Other minor fixes in lispifying names.

            Thanks to Thomas Weidner for the patch.
            - when feature export is set (export 'foo) is 
              generated for every symbol
            - when feature inline is set (declaim (inline foo)) is 
              generated before every function definition
            - when feature intern_function is set 
              #.(value-of-intern-function "name" "nodeType" package)
              is emitted instead of the plain symbol. A sample swig-lispify 
              is provided.
            - every symbol is prefixed by it's package.

	    Fixed the generation of wrappers for global variables. 
            Added the option [no]swig-lisp which turns on/off generation 
            of code for swig helper lisp macro, functions, etc.
