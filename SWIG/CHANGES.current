02/22/2006: mmatus 

	    When using directors, now swig will emit all the virtual
	    protected methods by default. 

	    In previous releases, you needed to use the 'dirprot'
	    option to acheive the same.

	    If you want, you can disable the new default behaviour,
	    use the 'nodirprot' option: 

	       swig -nodirprot ...

	    and/or the %nodirector feature for specific methods, i.e.:

	       %nodirector Foo::bar;

	       struct Foo {
	         virtual ~Foo();

	       protected:
	         virtual void bar();
	       };
	    

	    As before, pure abstract protected members are allways
	    emitted, independent of the 'dirprot/nodirprot' options.


02/22/2006: mmatus
	    Add the factory.i library for languages using the UTL (python,tcl,ruby,perl).
	    
            factory.i implements a more natural wrap for factory methods. 

	    For example, if you have:							    
	    								    
  	    ----  geometry.h --------					    
  	         struct Geometry {                          		    
  	           enum GeomType{			     			    
  	             POINT,				     		    
  	             CIRCLE				     		    
  	           };					     		    
  	           					     		    
  	           virtual ~Geometry() {}    		     		    
  	           virtual int draw() = 0;				    
  	    	 							    
  	    	 //							    
  	    	 // Factory method for all the Geometry objects		    
  	    	 //							    
  	           static Geometry *create(GeomType i);     		    
  	         };					     		    
  	         					     			    
  	         struct Point : Geometry  {		     		    
  	           int draw() { return 1; }		     		    
  	           double width() { return 1.0; }    	     		    
  	         };					     		    
  	         					     			    
  	         struct Circle : Geometry  {		     		    
  	           int draw() { return 2; }		     		    
  	           double radius() { return 1.5; }          		    
  	         }; 					     		    
  	         								    
  	         //							    
  	         // Factory method for all the Geometry objects		    
  	         //							    
  	         Geometry *Geometry::create(GeomType type) {		    
  	           switch (type) {			     		    
  	           case POINT: return new Point();	     		    
  	           case CIRCLE: return new Circle(); 	     		    
  	           default: return 0;			     		    
  	           }					     		    
  	         }					    		    
  	    ----  geometry.h --------					    
	    								    
	    								    
	    You can use the %factory with the Geometry::create method as follows:
	    								    
  	      %newobject Geometry::create;				    
  	      %factory(Geometry *Geometry::create, Point, Circle);	    
  	      %include "geometry.h"					    
	    								    
  	    and Geometry::create will return a 'Point' or 'Circle' instance   
  	    instead of the plain 'Geometry' type. For example, in python:	    
	    								    
  	      circle = Geometry.create(Geometry.CIRCLE)			    
  	      r = circle.radius()						    
	    								    
  	    where 'circle' now is a Circle proxy instance.

	    [MzScheme] Typemaps for all integral types now accept the full range of integral
	    values, and they signal an error when a value outside the valid range is passed.
	    [Guile] Typemaps for all integral types now signal an error when a value outside
	    the valid range is passed.

02/13/2006: mgossage
            [Documents] updated the extending documents to give a skeleton swigging code
            with a few typemaps.
            [Lua] added an extra typemap for void* [in], so a function which requires a void*
            can take any kind of pointer
