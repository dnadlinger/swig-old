SWIG Source directory

This directory currently contains a mix of legacy SWIG1.1 code and
recent development work.  As a result, it's still a little messy.
Here is a rough breakdown of the directories:

 Source/DOH          -  A core set of basic datatypes including
                        strings, lists, hashes, and files.  Used
                        extensively by the rest of SWIG.

 Source/Swig         -  Swig core. Type-system, utility functions.

 Source/Preprocessor -  SWIG C Preprocessor

 Source/CParse       -  SWIG C Parser (still messy)

 Source/Modules1.1   -  Old SWIG1.1 derived language modules.
                        Remaining legacy code.


The following directories may be in CVS, but are largely deprecated:

 Source/Modules      -  Some experimental module work.  New
                        modules may be added here eventually.

 Source/LParse       -  Experimental parser.  Officially dead
                        as CParse is more capable.

 Source/SWIG1.1      -  Old SWIG1.1 core. Completely empty now.
