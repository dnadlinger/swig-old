** [ttn] add test-suite based on Examples

[open] The behavior of SWIG with respect to call/return-by-value needs
       to be verified for all language modules.   Previously, the
       parser automatically performed the conversion of pass-by-value
       to pass-by-reference.  Unfortunately, this confused typemap
       handling and other aspects of the system.   I have removed
       this behavior.  However, in doing so, the handling of user
       defined types is passed on to the language modules.

[open] All of the SWIG 1.1p5 examples need to be verified.  Changes
       in type handling and internal data structures may have broken
       a variety of things.
