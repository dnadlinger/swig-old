<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

This document details SWIG internals: architecture and sometimes
implementation.  The first few sections concentrate on data structures,
interfaces, conventions and code shared by all language targets.
Subsequent sections focus on a particular language.

<p>
The audience is assumed to be SWIG developers (who should also read the
<a href="engineering.html">SWIG Engineering Manual</a> before starting
to code).

<h3>Overall Program Flow</h3>

Here is the general control flow and where under subdir <tt>Source</tt>
to look for code:

<ul>

<li> <tt>Modules1.1/swigmain.cxx:main()</tt> is the program entry
point.  It parses the language-specifying command-line option (for
example, <tt>-java</tt>), creating a new language-specific wrapping
object (each language is a C++ class derived from base class
<tt>Language</tt>).  This object and the command-line is passed to
<tt>SWIG_main()</tt>, whose return value is the program exit value.

<li> <tt>SWIG1.1/main.cxx:SWIG_main()</tt> is the "real" main.  It
initializes the preprocessor and typemap machinery, defines some
preprocessor symbols, locates the SWIG library, processes common
command-line options, and then calls the language-specific command-line
parser.  From here there are three paths: "help", "checkout" and
everything else.
  <ul>
  <li> In "help" mode, clean up open files and exit.
  <li> In "checkout" mode, copy specified files from the SWIG library
       to the current directory.  Errors cause error messages but no
       non-lcoal exits. 
  <li> Otherwise, do wrapping: determine output file name(s), define
       some preprocessor symbols and run the preprocessor, initialize
       the interface-definition parser, set up the typemap for handling
       new return strings, and finally do the language-specific parse
       (by calling the language object's <tt>parse()</tt> method), which
       creates output files by side-effect.
  </ul>
Afterwards, remove temporary files, and clean up.  If the command-line
included <tt>-freeze</tt>, go into an infinite loop; otherwise return the
error count.

<li> The language-specific <tt>parse()</tt> (and all other
language-specific code) lives in <tt>Modules1.1/foo.{h,cxx}</tt> for
language Foo.  Typically, <tt>FOO::parse()</tt> calls
<tt>FOO::headers()</tt> and then the global function <tt>yyparse()</tt>,
which uses the callbacks registered by <tt>SWIG_main()</tt> above. 

</ul>

<h2>2. DOH</h2>
</a>

DOH is a collection of low-level objects such as strings, lists, and
hash tables upon which the rest of SWIG is built.  The name 'DOH'
unofficially stands for "Dave's Object Hack", but it's also a good
expletive to use when things don't work (as in "SWIG core
dumped---DOH!").

<h3>2.1  Motivation and Background</h3>

The development of DOH is influenced heavily by the problems
encountered during earlier attempts to create a C++ based version of
SWIG2.0.  In each of these attempts (over a 3 year period), the
resulting system always ended up growing into a collossal nightmare of
large inheritance hierarchies and dozens of specialized classes for
different types of objects (functions, variables, constants, etc.).
The end result was that the system was tremendously complicated,
difficult to understand, difficult to maintain, and fairly inflexible
in the grand scheme of things.

<p>
DOH takes a different approach to tackling the complexity problem.
First, rather than going overboard with dozens of types and class
definitions, DOH only defines a handful of simple yet very useful
objects that are easy to remember.  Second, DOH uses dynamic
typing---one of the features that make scripting languages so useful
and which make it possible to accomplish things with much less code.
Finally, DOH utilizes a few coding tricks that allow it to perform
a limited form of function overloading for certain C datatypes (more
on that a little later). 

<p>
The key point to using DOH is that instead of thinking about code in
terms of highly specialized C data structures, just about everything
ends up being represented in terms of a just a few datatypes. For
example, structures are replaced by DOH hash tables whereas arrays are
replaced by DOH lists.  At first, this is probably a little strange to
most C/C++ programmers, but in the long run in makes the system
extremely flexible and highly extensible.  Also, in terms of coding,
many of the newly DOH-based subsystems are less than half the size (in
lines of code) of the earlier C++ implementation.

<h3>2.2 Basic Types</h3>

The following built-in types are currently provided by DOH:

<ul>
<li><b>String</b>.  A string of characters with automatic memory
management and high-level operations such as string replacement.  In addition,
strings support file I/O operations that make it possible to use them just
about anyplace a file can be used.

<p>
<li><b>List</b>. A list of arbitrary DOH objects (of possibly mixed types). 

<p>
<li><b>Hash</b>. A hash table that maps a set of string keys to a set of arbitrary
DOH objects.  The DOH version of an associative array for all of you Perl fans.

<p>
<li><b>File</b>. A DOH wrapper around the C FILE * structure.  This is provided
since other objects sometimes want to behave like files (strings for instance).

<p>
<li><b>Void</b>. A DOH wrapper around an arbitrary C pointer.  This can be used
if you want to place arbitrary C data structures in DOH lists and hash tables.
</ul>

Due to dynamic typing, all of the objects in DOH are represented by pointers
of type <tt>DOH *</tt>.  Furthermore, all objects are completely
opaque--that means that the only way to access the internals of an
object is through a well-defined public API.   For convenience, the following
symbolic names are sometimes used to improve readability:

<ul>
<Li><tt>DOHString *</tt>.  A String object.
<li><tt>DOHList *</tt>. A list object.
<li><tt>DOHHash *</tt>. A hash object.
<li><tt>DOHFile *</tt>. A file object.
<li><tt>DOHVoid *</tt>. A void object.
<li><tt>DOHString_or_char *</tt>. A DOH String object or a raw C "char *".
</ul>

It should be stressed that all of these names are merely symbolic aliases to the
type <tt>DOH *</tt> and that no compile-time type checking is performed (of course,
a runtime error may occur if you screw up).

<h3>2.3 Creating, Copying, and Destroying Objects </h2>

The following functions can be used to create new DOH objects

<ul>
<Li><tt>NewString(DOHString_or_char *value)</tt><br>
Create a new string object with contents initially
set to value.  value can be either a C string or a DOH string object.

<p>
<li><tt>NewStringf(char *fmt, ...)</tt><br>
Create a new string object with contents initially set to
a formatted string.  Think of this as being sprintf() combined with an object constructor.

<p>
<li><tt>NewList()</tt><br>
Create a new list object that is initially empty.

<p>
<Li><tt>NewHash()</tt><br>
Create a new hash object that is initially empty.

<p>
<li><tt>NewFile(DOHString_or_char *filename, char *mode)</tt><br>
Open a file and return a file object.  This is a
wrapper around the C <tt>fopen()</tt> library call.

<p>
<li><tt>NewFileFromFile(FILE *f)</tt><br>
Create a new file object given an already opened <tt>FILE *</tt> object.

<p>
<li><tt>NewVoid(void *obj, void (*del)(void *))</tt><br>
Create a new DOH object that is a wrapper around an
arbitrary C pointer.  <tt>del</tt> is an optional destructor function that will be called when the object
is destroyed.

</ul>

Any object can be copied using the <tt>Copy()</tt> function. For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
DOH *a, *b, *c, *d;
a = NewString("Hello World");
b = NewList();
c = Copy(a);         /* Copy the string a */
d = Copy(b);         /* Copy the list b */
</pre>
</blockquote>

Copies of lists and hash tables are shallow.  That is, their contents are only copied by reference.

<p>
Objects can be deleted using the <tt>Delete()</tt> function. For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
DOH *a = NewString("Hello World");
...
Delete(a);              /* Destroy a */
</pre>
</blockquote>

All objects are referenced counted and given a reference count of 1 when initially created.  The
<tt>Delete()</tt> function only destroys an object when the reference count reaches zero.  When
an object is placed in a list or hash table, it's reference count is automatically increased. For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
DOH *a, *b;
a = NewString("Hello World");
b = NewList();
Append(b,a);         /* Increases refcnt of a to 2 */
Delete(a);           /* Decreases refcnt of a to 1 */
Delete(b);           /* Destroys b, and destroys a */
</pre>
</blockquote>

Should it ever be necessary to manually increase the reference count of an object, the DohIncref() function
can be used:

<blockquote>
<pre>
DOH *a = NewString("Hello");
DohIncref(a);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>2.4 A Word About Mutability and Copying</h3>

All DOH objects are mutable regardless of their current reference
count.  For example, if you create a string and then create a 1000
references to it (in lists and hash tables), changes to the string
will be reflected in all of the references.  Therefore, if you need to
make any kind of local change, you should first make a copy using the
Copy() function.  Caveat:  when copying lists and hash tables, elements
are copied by reference.

<h3>2.5 Strings</h3>

The DOH String type is perhaps the most flexible object.  First, it supports a variety of string-oriented
operations.  Second, it supports many of the same operations as lists.  Finally, strings provide file I/O
operations that allow them to be used interchangably with DOH file objects.

<h2>10. Guile Support</h2>
</a>

This section details guile-specific support in SWIG.

<h3>Meaning of "Module"</h3>

<p>
There are three different concepts of "module" involved, defined
separately for SWIG, Guile, and Libtool.  To avoid horrible confusion,
we explicitly prefix the context, e.g., "guile-module".

<h3>Linkage</h3>

<p>
Guile support is complicated by a lack of user community cohesiveness,
which manifests in multiple shared-library usage conventions.  A set of
policies implementing a usage convention is called a <b>linkage</b>.
The default linkage is the simplest; nothing special is done.  In this
case <code>SWIG_init()</code> is provided and users must do something
like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
(define my-so (dynamic-link "./example.so"))
(dynamic-call "SWIG_init" my-so)
</pre>
</blockquote>

At this time, the name <code>SWIG_init</code> is hardcoded; this
approach does not work with multiple swig-modules.  NOTE: The "simple"
and "matrix" examples under Examples/guile include guilemain.i; the
resulting standalone interpreter does not require calls to
<code>dynamic-link</code> and <code>dynamic-call</code>, as shown here.

<p>
A second linkage creates "libtool dl module" wrappers, and currently is
broken.  Whoever fixes this needs to track Guile's libtool dl module
convention, since that is not finalized.

<p>
The only other linkage supported at this time creates shared object
libraries suitable for use by hobbit's <code>(hobbit4d link)</code>
guile module.  This is called the "hobbit" linkage, and requires also
using the "-package" command line option to set the part of the module
name before the last symbol.  For example, both command lines:
[checkme:ttn]

<blockquote>
<pre>
swig -guile -package my/lib foo.i
swig -guile -package my/lib -module foo foo.i
</pre>
</blockquote>

would create module <code>(my lib foo)</code> (assuming in the first
case foo.i declares the module to be "foo").  The installed files are
my/lib/libfoo.so.X.Y.Z and friends.  This scheme is still very
experimental; the (hobbit4d link) conventions are not well understood.

<p>
There are no other linkage types planned, but that could change...  To
add a new type, add the name to the enum in guile.h and add the case to
<code>GUILE::emit_linkage()</code>.

<h3>Underscore Folding</h3>  

<p>
Underscores are converted to dashes in identifiers.  Guile support may
grow an option to inhibit this folding in the future, but no one has
complained so far.

<h3>Typemaps</h3>

<p>
It used to be that the mappings for "native" types were included in
guile.cxx.  This information is now in Lib/guile/typemaps.i, which
presents a new challenge: how to have SWIG include typemaps.i before
processing the user's foo.i.  At this time, we must say:

<blockquote>
<pre>
%include guile/typemaps.i
</pre>
</blockquote>

in foo.i.  This may change in the future.

<h3>Smobs</h3>

<p>
For pointer types, SWIG uses Guile smobs.  This feature used to be
available only SWIG was invoked with the command-line option
"-with-smobs", but as of 2000/07/06 (swig-1.1a4) this is the default
behavior; the command-line option "-with-smobs" is ignored silently.

<p>
Currently, one wrapper module must be generated without
<code>-c</code> and compiled with <code>-DSWIG_GLOBAL</code>, all the
other wrapper modules must be generated with <code>-c</code>.  Maybe
one should move all the global helper functions that come from
<code>guile.swg</code> into a library, which is built by <code>make
runtime</code>. 

<p>
In earlier versions of SWIG, C pointers were represented as Scheme
strings containing a hexadecimal rendering of the pointer value and a
mangled type name.  As Guile allows registering user types, so-called
"smobs" (small objects), a much cleaner representation has been
implemented now.  The details will be discussed in the following.

<p>
A smob is a cons cell where the lower half of the CAR contains the
smob type tag, while the upper half of the CAR and the whole CDR are
available.  <code>SWIG_Guile_Init()</code> registers a smob type named
"swig" with Guile; its type tag is stored in the variable
<code>swig_tag</code>.  The upper half of the CAR store an index into
a table of all C pointer types seen so far, to which new types seen
are appended.  The CDR stores the pointer value.  SWIG smobs print
like this: <code>#&lt;swig struct xyzzy * 0x1234affe&gt;</code>  Two of
them are <code>equal?</code> if and only if they have the same type
and value.

<p>
To construct a Scheme object from a C pointer, the wrapper code calls
the function <code>SWIG_Guile_MakePtr_Str()</code>, passing both a
mangled type string and a pretty type string.  The former is looked up
in the type table to get the type index to store in the upper half of
the CAR.  If the type is new, it is appended to type table.

<p>
To get the pointer represented by a smob, the wrapper code calls the
function <code>SWIG_Guile_GetPtr_Str</code>, passing the mangled name
of the expected pointer type, which is used for looking up the type in
the type table and accessing the list of compatible types.  If the
Scheme object passed was not a SWIG smob representing a compatible
pointer, a <code>wrong-type-arg</code> exception is raised.

<h3>Exception Handling</h3>

<p>
SWIG code calls <code>scm_error</code> on exception, using the following
mapping:

<pre>
      MAP(SWIG_MemoryError,	"swig-memory-error");
      MAP(SWIG_IOError,		"swig-io-error");
      MAP(SWIG_RuntimeError,	"swig-runtime-error");
      MAP(SWIG_IndexError,	"swig-index-error");
      MAP(SWIG_TypeError,	"swig-type-error");
      MAP(SWIG_DivisionByZero,	"swig-division-by-zero");
      MAP(SWIG_OverflowError,	"swig-overflow-error");
      MAP(SWIG_SyntaxError,	"swig-syntax-error");
      MAP(SWIG_ValueError,	"swig-value-error");
      MAP(SWIG_SystemError,	"swig-system-error");
</pre>

<p>
The default when not specified here is to use "swig-error".
