<a name="n2"></a><H2>1.1 What is SWIG?</H2>


SWIG is a software development tool that simplifies the task of
interfacing different languages to C and C++ programs.  In a
nutshell, SWIG is a compiler that takes C declarations and creates
the wrappers needed to access those declarations from other languages including
including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, Guile, and Java.  SWIG normally
requires no modifications to existing code and can often be used to
build a usable interface in only a few minutes.  Possible applications
of SWIG include:

<p>
<ul>
<li>Building interpreted interfaces to existing C programs.
<li>Rapid prototyping and application development.
<li>Interactive debugging.
<li>Reengineering or refactoring of legacy software into a scripting language components.
<li>Making a graphical user interface (using Tk for example).
<li>Testing of C libraries and programs (using scripts).
<li>Building high performance C modules for scripting languages.
<li>Making C programming more enjoyable (or tolerable depending on your point of view).
<li>Impressing your friends.
<li>Obtaining vast sums of research funding (although obviously not applicable to the author).
</ul>

<p>
SWIG was originally designed to make it extremely easy for scientists
and engineers to build extensible scientific software without having to get a
degree in software engineering.  Because of this, the use of
SWIG tends to be somewhat informal and ad-hoc (e.g., SWIG does not
require users to provide formal interface specifications as you would find in
a dedicated IDL compiler).  Although
this style of development isn't appropriate for every
project, it is particularly well suited to software development in the
small; especially the research and development work that is commonly found
in scientific and engineering projects.

<a name="n3"></a><H2>1.2 Why use SWIG?</H2>


Although C is great for high-performance number crunching and systems
programming, trying to make an interactive and highly flexible C
program is a pain.  Even though it is possible to build a user
interface using command line options, a home grown command
interpreter, or a graphical user interface, this often results in a
program that is hard to extend, hard to modify, hard to port between
platforms, and hard to use.  Furthermore, this sort of activity wastes
a lot of development time because it usually diverts everyone's attention away
from the real problem that they're trying to solve.

<p>
Many of the problems with C are due to the way in which 
many programs are organized.  For example, a lot of programs
are structured as follows:

<p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of functions and variables that do something useful.
<li>A <tt>main()</tt> program that starts everything.
<li>A horrible collection of hacks that form some kind of user interface (but 
which no-one really wants to touch).
</ul>

<p>
In this case, the <tt>main()</tt> program may read command line
options or simple commands from <tt>stdin</tt>.  However, modifying or
extending the program to do something new requires changing the C
code, recompiling, and testing. If you make a mistake, you need to
repeat this cycle until things work.  Of course, as more and more
features are added, the program usually turns into a horrible mess
that is even more difficult to modify than before (although this
undoubtedly increases the job security of the programmer).

<p>
A common mistake is to assume that all of the problems with C can somehow be
fixed by using a better C---perhaps an undebuggable
language with unreadable syntax, complicated semantics, and nearly
infinite compilation time.  This is an unfortunate.

<P>
Perhaps a better approach is to place your application under the control
of a very high-level language such as a common scripting language
interpreter.  High level languages excel at turning hard problems into
easy tasks.   They also provide a nice framework for managing software components
and gluing different systems together.  Not only that, they make it easy
for users to configure the software to their liking and to program it to perform
new tasks without ever having to touch a C/C++ compiler.  

<p>
SWIG simplifies the task of incorporating C++ code into a high-level
programming environment.  Specifically, rather than creating a huge
monolithic package, SWIG allows you to restructure your application as
a collection of functions and variables that can be accessed from the
convenience of a high-level language.  With this model, all of the
functionality of your C program is retained.  The only difference is
that the high-level program logic and control is now driven by the
high-level language instead of a low level
<tt>main()</tt> function.

<p>
SWIG tries to make the integration between scripting languages and C
as painless as possible. This allows you to focus on the underlying C
program and using the high-level scripting language interface, but not
the tedious and complex chore of making the two languages talk to each
other.<p>
<p>

<a name="n4"></a><H2>1.3 A SWIG example</H2>


The best way to illustrate SWIG is with a simple example. Consider the
following C code: <p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>/* File : example.c */

double  My_variable  = 3.0;

/* Compute factorial of n */
int  fact(int n) {
	if (n &lt;= 1) return 1;
	else return n*fact(n-1);
}

/* Compute n mod m */
int my_mod(int n, int m) {
	return(n % m);
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Suppose that you wanted to access these functions and the global
variable <tt>My_variable</tt> from Tcl.  You start by making a SWIG
interface file as shown below (by convention, these files carry a .i
suffix) : <p>

<a name="n5"></a><H3>1.3.1 SWIG interface file</H3>


<blockquote><pre>
/* File : example.i */
%module example
%{
/* Put headers and other declarations here */
%}

extern double My_variable;
extern int    fact(int);
extern int    my_mod(int n, int m);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The interface file contains ANSI C function prototypes and variable
declarations.  The <tt>%module</tt> directive defines the name of the
module that will be created by SWIG.  The <tt>%{,%}</tt> block
provides a location for inserting additional code such as C header
files or additional C declarations. <p>

<a name="n6"></a><H3>1.3.2 The swig command</H3>


SWIG is invoked using the <tt>swig</tt> command. We can use this to
build a Tcl module (under Linux) as follows :<p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>unix &gt; <b>swig -tcl example.i</b>
unix &gt; <b>gcc -c -fpic example.c example_wrap.c -I/usr/local/include</b>
unix &gt; <b>gcc -shared example.o example_wrap.o -o example.so</b>
unix &gt; <b>tclsh</b>
% <b>load ./example.so</b>
% <b>fact 4</b>
24
% <b>my_mod 23 7</b>
2
% <b>expr $My_variable + 4.5</b>
7.5
%
</pre></blockquote>
	<p>

The <tt>swig</tt> command produced a new file called
<tt>example_wrap.c</tt> that should be compiled along with the
<tt>example.c</tt> file.  Most operating systems and scripting
languages now support dynamic loading of modules.  In our example, our
Tcl module has been compiled into a shared library that can be loaded
into Tcl.  When loaded, Tcl can now access the functions
and variables declared in the SWIG interface.  A look at the file
<tt>example_wrap.c</tt> reveals a hideous mess.  However, you 
almost never need to worry about it.<p>

<a name="n7"></a><H3>1.3.3 Building a Perl5 module</H3>


Now, let's turn these functions into a Perl5 module. Without making
any changes type the following (shown for Solaris):<p>

<p>
<p>
<blockquote><pre>unix &gt; <b>swig -perl5 example.i</b>
unix &gt; <b>gcc -c example.c example_wrap.c \
	-I/usr/local/lib/perl5/sun4-solaris/5.003/CORE</b>
unix &gt; <b>ld -G example.o example_wrap.o -o example.so</b>		# This is for Solaris
unix &gt; <b>perl5.003
use example;
print example::fact(4), "\n";
print example::my_mod(23,7), "\n";
print $example::My_variable + 4.5, "\n";
&lt;ctrl-d&gt;</b>
24
2
7.5
unix &gt;
</pre></blockquote>


<a name="n8"></a><H3>1.3.4 Building a Python module</H3>


Finally, let's build a module for Python (shown for Irix).<p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>unix &gt; <b>swig -python example.i</b>
unix &gt; <b>gcc -c -fpic example.c example_wrap.c -I/usr/local/include/python2.0</b>
unix &gt; <b>gcc -shared example.o example_wrap.o -o _example.so</b>
unix &gt; <b>python</b>
Python 2.0 (#6, Feb 21 2001, 13:29:45)
[GCC egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)] on linux2
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.     
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>import example</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>example.fact(4)</b>
24
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>example.my_mod(23,7)</b>
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>example.cvar.My_variable + 4.5</b>
7.5
</pre></blockquote>

<a name="n9"></a><H3>1.3.5 Shortcuts</H3>


To the truly lazy programmer, one may wonder why we needed the extra
interface file at all. As it turns out, you can often do without
it. For example, you could also build a Perl5 module by just running
SWIG on the C header file and specifying a module name as follows<p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>unix &gt; <b>swig -perl5 -module example example.h</b>
unix &gt; <b>gcc -c example.c example_wrap.c \
	-I/usr/local/lib/perl5/sun4-solaris/5.003/CORE</b>
unix &gt; <b>ld -G example.o example_wrap.o -o example.so</b>
unix &gt; <b>perl5.003
use example;
print example::fact(4), "\n";
print example::my_mod(23,7), "\n";
print $example::My_variable + 4.5, "\n";
&lt;ctrl-d&gt;</b>
24
2
7.5
</pre></blockquote>

<a name="n10"></a><H3>1.3.6 Building libraries and modules</H3>


In addition to generating wrapper code, SWIG provides extensive
support for handling multiple files and building interface
libraries. For example, our <tt>example.i</tt> file, could be used in
another interface as follows :<p>

<p>
<blockquote><pre>%module foo
%include example.i             // Get definitions from example.i

... Now more declarations ...

</pre></blockquote>
In a large system, an interface might be built from a variety of pieces like this :<p>
<p>
<blockquote><pre>%module package

%include network.i
%include file.i
%include graphics.i
%include objects.i
%include simulation.i

</pre></blockquote>

SWIG comes with a library of existing functions known as the SWIG
library.  The library contains a mix of language independent and
language dependent functionality.  For example, the file
`<tt>array.i</tt>' provides access to C arrays while the file
`<tt>wish.i</tt>' includes specialized code for rebuilding the Tcl
wish interpreter.  Using the library, you can use existing modules to
build up your own personalized environment for building interfaces.
If changes are made to any of the components, they will appear
automatically the next time SWIG is run. <p>

<a name="n11"></a><H2>1.4 Supported C/C++ language features</H2>


A primary goal of the SWIG project is to make the language binding
process extremely easy.  Although a few simple examples have been shown,
SWIG is quite capable in supporting most of C++.  Some of the
major features include:

<ul>
<li>Full C99 preprocessing.
<li>All ANSI C and C++ datatypes.
<li>Functions, variables, and constants.
<li>Classes.
<li>Single and multiple inheritance.
<li>Overloaded functions and methods.
<li>Overloaded operators.
<li>C++ templates (including member templates, specialization, and partial specialization).
<li>Namespaces.
<li>Variable length arguments.
<li>C++ smart pointers.
</ul>

Currently, the only C++ feature not supported is nested classes--a limitation
that will be removed in a future release.

<p>
It is important to stress that SWIG is not a simplistic C++ lexing
tool like several apparently similar wrapper generation tools.  SWIG
not only parses C++, it implements the full C++ type system and it is
able to understand C++ semantics.  SWIG generates its wrappers with
full knowledge of this information.  As a result, you will find SWIG
to be just as capable of dealing with nasty corner cases as it is in
wrapping simple C++ code.  In fact, SWIG is able handle C++ code that
stresses the very limits of many C++ compilers.


<a name="n12"></a><H2>1.5 Non-intrusive interface building</H2>


When used as intended, SWIG requires minimal modification to
existing C code. This makes SWIG extremely easy to use with existing
packages and promotes software reuse and modularity. By making
the C code independent of the high level interface, you can change the
interface and reuse the code in other applications.   It is also
possible to support different types of interfaces depending on the application.

<a name="n13"></a><H2>1.6 Hands off code generation</H2>


SWIG is designed to produce working code that needs no
hand-modification (in fact, if you look at the output, you probably
won't want to modify it). Ideally, SWIG should be invoked
automatically inside a Makefile just as one would call the C
compiler. You should think of your scripting language interface being
defined entirely by the input to SWIG, not the resulting output
file. While this approach may limit flexibility for hard-core hackers,
it allows others to forget about the low-level implementation
details.
