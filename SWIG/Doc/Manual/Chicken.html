    <p>
      This chapter describes SWIG's support of CHICKEN.  CHICKEN is a
      Scheme-to-C compiler supporting most of the language features as
      defined in the <i>Revised^5 Report on Scheme</i>.  Its main
      attributes are that it
    </p>

      <ol>
	<li>generates portable C code</li>
	<li>includes a customizable interpreter</li>
	<li>links to C libraries with a simple Foreign Function Interface</li>
	<li>supports full tail-recursion and first-class continuations</li>
      </ol>

    <p>
      When confronted with a large C library, CHICKEN users can use
      SWIG to generate CHICKEN wrappers for the C library.  However,
      the real advantages of using SWIG with CHICKEN are its
      <strong>support for C++</strong> -- object-oriented code is
      difficult to wrap by hand in CHICKEN -- and its <strong>typed
      pointer representation</strong>, essential for C and C++
      libraries involving structures or classes.

    </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn2"></a>17.1 Preliminaries</H2>


    <p>
      CHICKEN support was introduced to SWIG in version 1.3.18.  SWIG
      relies on some recent additions to CHICKEN, which are only
      present in releases of CHICKEN with version number
      <strong>greater than or equal to 1.89</strong>.  
      To use a chicken version between 1.40 and 1.89, see the <a href="#collection">Garbage collection</a>
      section below.
    </p>

      <p>
      You may want to look at any of the examples in Examples/chicken/
      or Examples/GIFPlot/Chicken for the basic steps to run SWIG
      CHICKEN.
      </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn3"></a>17.1.1 Running SWIG in C mode</H3>


      <p>
      To run SWIG CHICKEN in C mode, use
      the -chicken option.
      </p>

      <div class="shell">
	<pre>% swig -chicken example.i</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
      To allow the wrapper to take advantage of future CHICKEN code
      generation improvements, part of the wrapper is direct CHICKEN
      function calls (<tt>example_wrap.c</tt>) and part is CHICKEN
      Scheme (<tt>example.scm</tt>).  The basic Scheme code must
      be compiled to C using your system's CHICKEN compiler.
      </p>

      <div class="shell">
	<pre>% chicken example.scm -output-file oexample.c</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
      So for the C mode of SWIG CHICKEN, <tt>example_wrap.c</tt> and
      <tt>oexample.c</tt> are the files that must be compiled to
      object files and linked into your project.
      </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn4"></a>17.1.2 Running SWIG in C++ mode</H3>


      <p>
      To run SWIG CHICKEN in C++ mode, use
      the -chicken -c++ option.
      </p>

      <div class="shell">
	<pre>% swig -chicken -c++ example.i</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
      This will generate <tt>example_wrap.cxx</tt> and
      <tt>example.scm</tt>.  The basic Scheme code must be
      compiled to C using your system's CHICKEN compiler.
      </p>

      <div class="shell">
	<pre>% chicken example.scm -output-file oexample.c</pre>
      </div>

      <p>
      So for the C++ mode of SWIG CHICKEN, <tt>example_wrap.cxx</tt>
      and <tt>oexample.c</tt> are the files that must be compiled to
      object files and linked into your project.
      </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn5"></a>17.2 Code Generation</H2>


<H3><a name="Chicken_nn6"></a>17.2.1 Naming Conventions</H3>


    <p>
      Given a C variable, function or constant declaration named
      <tt>Foo_Bar</tt>, the declaration will be available
      in CHICKEN as an identifier ending with
      <tt>Foo-Bar</tt>.  That is, an underscore is converted
      to a dash.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may control what the CHICKEN identifier will be by using the
      <tt>%rename</tt> SWIG directive in the SWIG interface file.
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn7"></a>17.2.2 Modules</H3>


      <p>
      The name of the module must be declared one of two ways:
      <ul>
	<li>Placing <tt>%module example</tt> in the SWIG interface
	  file.</li>
	<li>Using <tt>-module example</tt> on the SWIG command
	  line.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      The generated example.scm file then exports <code>(declare (unit modulename))</code>.
      If you do not want SWIG to export the <code>(declare (unit modulename))</code>, pass
      the -nounit option to SWIG.

    <p>
      CHICKEN will be able to access the module using the <code>(declare
	(uses <i>modulename</i>))</code> CHICKEN Scheme form.
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn8"></a>17.2.3 Constants and Variables</H3>


    <p>
      Constants may be created using any of the four constructs in
      the interface file:
    </p>
      <ol>
	<li><code>#define MYCONSTANT1 ...</code></li>
	<li><code>%constant int MYCONSTANT2 = ...</code></li>
	<li><code>const int MYCONSTANT3 = ...</code></li>
	<li><code>enum { MYCONSTANT4  = ... };</code></li>
      </ol>

    <p>
      In all cases, the constants may be accessed from with CHICKEN
      using the form <tt>(MYCONSTANT1)</tt>; that is, the constants
      may be accessed using the read-only parameter form.
    </p>

    <p>
      Variables are accessed using the full parameter form.
      For example, to set the C variable "int my_variable;", use the
      Scheme form <tt>(my-variable 2345)</tt>.  To get the C variable,
      use <tt>(my-variable)</tt>.
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn9"></a>17.2.4 Functions</H3>


    <p>
      C functions declared in the SWIG interface file will have
      corresponding CHICKEN Scheme procedures.  For example, the C
      function "int sqrt(double x);" will be available using the
      Scheme form <tt>(sqrt 2345.0)</tt>.  A <code>void</code> return
      value will give C_SCHEME_UNDEFINED as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      A function may return more than one value by using the
      <code>OUTPUT</code> specifier (see Lib/chicken/typemaps.i).
      They will be returned as a Scheme list if there is more than one
      result (that is, a non-void return value and at least one argout
      parameter, or a void return value and at least two argout
      parameters).
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn10"></a>17.2.5 Exceptions</H3>


     <p>The SWIG chicken module has support for exceptions thrown from
     C or C++ code to be caught in scheme.  
     See <a href="Customization.html#exception">Exception handling with %exception</a>
     for more information about declaring exceptions in the interface file.
     </p>

     <p>Chicken supports both the <code>SWIG_exception(int code, const char *msg)</code> interface
     as well as a <code>SWIG_ThrowException(C_word val)</code> function for throwing exceptions from
     inside the %exception blocks.  <code>SWIG_exception</code> will throw a list consiting of the code
     (as an integer) and the message.  Both of these will throw an exception using <code>(abort)</code>,
     which can be handled by <code>(handle-exceptions)</code>.  See
     <a href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/manual/Exceptions.html#Exceptions">Chicken manual on Exceptions</a>
     and <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-12/srfi-12.html">SFRI-12</a>.  Since the exception values are thrown
     directly, if <code>(condition-case)</code> is used to catch an exception the exception will come through in the <code>val ()</code> case.
     </p>

     <p>The following simple module</p>
     
<div class="code"><pre>
%module exception_test

%inline %{
  void test_throw(int i) throws (int) { 
    if (i == 1) throw 15; 
  }
%}
</pre></div>

     <p>could be run with</p>

<div class="targetlang"><pre>
(handle-exceptions exvar 
  (if (= exvar 15)
    (print "Correct!") 
    (print "Threw something else " exvar))
  (test-throw 1))
</pre></div>


<H2><a name="Chicken_nn11"></a>17.3 TinyCLOS</H2>


      <p>
      The author of TinyCLOS, Gregor Kiczales, describes TinyCLOS as:
	"Tiny CLOS is a Scheme implementation of a `kernelized' CLOS, with a
	metaobject protocol. The implementation is even simpler than
	the simple CLOS found in `The Art of the Metaobject Protocol,'
	weighing in at around 850 lines of code, including (some)
	comments and documentation."
      </p>

      <p>
      Almost all good Scheme books describe how to use metaobjects and
      generic procedures to implement an object-oriented Scheme
      system.  Please consult a Scheme book if you are unfamiliar
      with the concept.
      </p>

      <p>

      CHICKEN has a modified version of TinyCLOS, which SWIG CHICKEN
      uses if the -proxy argument is given.  If -proxy is passed, then
      the generated example.scm file will contain TinyCLOS class definitions.
      A class named Foo is declared as &lt;Foo&gt;, and each member variable
      is allocated a slot.  Member functions are exported as generic functions.

      <p>
      
      Primitive symbols and functions (the interface that would be presented if
      -proxy was not passed) are hidden and no longer accessable.  If the -unhideprimitive
      command line argument is passed to SWIG, then the primitive symbols will be
      available, but each will be prefixed by the string "primitive:"

      <p>

      The exported symbol names can be controlled with the -closprefix and -useclassprefix arguments.
      If -useclassprefix is passed to SWIG, every member function will be generated with the class name
      as a prefix.  If the -closprefix mymod: argument is passed to SWIG, then the exported functions will
      be prefixed by the string "mymod:".  If -useclassprefix is passed, -closprefix is ignored.
      
      </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn12"></a>17.4 Compilation</H2>


    <p>
      Please refer to <em>CHICKEN - A practical and portable Scheme
      system - User's manual</em> for detailed help on how to compile
      C code for use in a CHICKEN program.  Briefly, to compile C
      code, be sure to add <tt>`chicken-config -cflags`</tt> or
      <tt>`chicken-config -shared -cflags`</tt> to your compiler
      options.  Use the <tt>-shared</tt> option if you want to create
      a dynamically loadable module.  You might also want to use the
      much simpler <tt>csc</tt> or <tt>csc.bat</tt>.
    </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn13"></a>17.5 Linkage</H2>


    <p>
      Please refer to <em>CHICKEN - A practical and portable Scheme
      system - User's manual</em> for detailed help on how to link
      object files to create a CHICKEN Scheme program.  Briefly, to
      link object files, be sure to add <tt>`chicken-config
      -extra-libs -libs`</tt> or <tt>`chicken-config -shared
      -extra-libs -libs`</tt>to your linker options.  Use the
      <tt>-shared</tt> option if you want to create a dynamically
      loadable module.
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn14"></a>17.5.1 Shared library</H3>


    <p>
      The easiest way to use SWIG and CHICKEN is to use the csc compiler
      wrapper provided by CHICKEN.  Assume you have a SWIG interface file
      in example.i and the C functions being wrapped are in example_impl.c.
    </p>

<div class="shell">
<pre>
$ swig -chicken example.i
$ csc -svk example.scm example_impl.c example_wrap.c
$ csi example.so test_script.scm
</pre>
</div>

    <p>
      You must be careful not to name the example_impl.c file example.c because
      when compiling example.scm, csc compiles that into example.c!
    </p>

    <p>
      The test_script.scm should have <code>(load-library 'example "example.so")</code>
      and <code>(declare (uses example))</code>.  As well, the path to example.so should
      be accessable to the loader.  You might need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn15"></a>17.5.2 Static binary</H3>


   <p>Again, we can easily use csc to build a binary.</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre>
$ swig -chicken example.i
$ csc -vk example.scm example_impl.c example_wrap.c test_script.scm -o example
$ ./example
</pre>
</div>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn16"></a>17.6 Typemaps</H2>


    <p>
      The Chicken module handles all types via typemaps. This information is
      read from <code>Lib/chicken/typemaps.i</code> and
      <code>Lib/chicken/chicken.swg</code>.
    </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn17"></a>17.7 Pointers</H2>


    <p>
      For pointer types, SWIG uses CHICKEN tagged pointers.

      A tagged pointer is an ordinary CHICKEN pointer with an
      extra slot for a void *.  With SWIG
      CHICKEN, this void * is a pointer to a type-info
      structure.  So each pointer used as input or output from
      the SWIG-generated CHICKEN wrappers will have type
      information attached to it.  This will let the wrappers
      correctly determine which method should be called
      according to the object type hierarchy exposed in the SWIG
      interface files.
    </p>
    <p>
      To construct a Scheme object from a C pointer, the wrapper code
      calls the function 
      <code>SWIG_NewPointerObj(void *ptr, swig_type_info *type, int owner)</code>,
      The function that calls <code>SWIG_NewPointerObj</code> must have a variable declared
      <code>C_word *known_space = C_alloc(C_SIZEOF_SWIG_POINTER);</code>
      It is ok to call <code>SWIG_NewPointerObj</code> more than once, 
      just make sure known_space has enough space for all the created pointers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the pointer represented by a CHICKEN tagged pointer, the
      wrapper code calls the function 
      <code>SWIG_ConvertPtr(C_word s, void **result, swig_type_info *type, int flags)</code>,
      passing a pointer to a struct representing the expected pointer
      type. flags is either zero or SWIG_POINTER_DISOWN (see below).
    </p>

<H3><a name="collection"></a>17.7.1 Garbage collection</H3>


  <p>If the owner flag passed to <code>SWIG_NewPointerObj</code> is 1, <code>NewPointerObj</code> will add a
     finalizer to the type which will call the destructor or delete method of
     that type.  The destructor and delete functions are no longer exported for
     use in scheme code, instead SWIG and chicken manage pointers.
  In situations where SWIG knows that a function is returning a type that should
  be garbage collected, SWIG will automaticly set the owner flag to 1.  For other functions,
  the <code>%newobject</code> directive must be specified for functions whose return values
  should be garbage collected.  See 
  <a href="Customization.html#ownership">Object ownership and %newobject</a> for more information.
  </p>

  <p>In situations where a C or C++ function will assume ownership of a pointer, and thus
  chicken should no longer garbage collect it, SWIG provides the <code>DISOWN</code> input typemap.
  After applying this typemap (see the <a href="Typemaps.html">Typemaps chapter</a> for more information on how to apply typemaps),
  any pointer that gets passed in will no longer be garbage collected.  
  An object is disowned by passing the <code>SWIG_POINTER_DISOWN</code> flag to <code>SWIG_ConvertPtr</code>.
  <b>Warning:</b> Since the lifetime of the object is now controlled by the underlying code, the object might
  get deleted while the scheme code still holds a pointer to it.  Further use of this pointer
  can lead to a crash.
  </p>

  <p>Adding a finalizer function from C code was added to chicken in the 1.89 release, so garbage collection
  does not work for chicken versions below 1.89.  If you would like the SWIG generated code to work with
  chicken 1.40 to 1.89, pass the <code>-nocollection</code> argument to SWIG.  This will not export code
  inside the _wrap.c file to register finalizers, and will then export destructor functions which
  must be called manually.
  </p>
