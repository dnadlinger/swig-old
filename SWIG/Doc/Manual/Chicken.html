    <p>
      This chapter describes SWIG's support of CHICKEN.  CHICKEN is a
      Scheme-to-C compiler supporting most of the language features as
      defined in the <i>Revised^5 Report on Scheme</i>.  Its main
      attributes are that it
    </p>
      <ol>
	<li>generates portable C code</li>
	<li>includes a customizable interpreter</li>
	<li>links to C libraries with a simple Foreign Function Interface</li>
	<li>supports full tail-recursion and first-class continuations</li>
      </ol>

    <p>
      When confronted with a large C library, CHICKEN users can use
      SWIG to generate CHICKEN wrappers for the C library.  However,
      the real advantages of using SWIG with CHICKEN are its
      <strong>support for C++</strong> -- object-oriented code is
      difficult to wrap by hand in CHICKEN -- and its <strong>typed
      pointer representation</strong>, essential for C and C++
      libraries involving structures or classes.

    </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn2"></a>17.1 Preliminaries</H2>


    <p>
      CHICKEN support was introduced to SWIG in version 1.3.18.  SWIG
      relies on some recent additions to CHICKEN, which are only
      present in releases of CHICKEN with version number
      <strong>greater than or equal to <tt>1.40</tt></strong>.

      <br> CHICKEN can be downloaded from <a
      href="http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/">http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/</a>

      You may want to look at any of the examples in Examples/chicken/
      or Examples/GIFPlot/Chicken for the basic steps to run SWIG
      CHICKEN.

      We will generically refer to the <em>wrapper</em> as the
      generated files.

    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn3"></a>17.1.1 Running SWIG in C mode</H3>


      <p>
      To run SWIG CHICKEN in C mode, use
      the -chicken option.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>% swig -chicken example.i</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      To allow the wrapper to take advantage of future CHICKEN code
      generation improvements, part of the wrapper is direct CHICKEN
      function calls (<tt>example_wrap.c</tt>) and part is CHICKEN
      Scheme (<tt>example.scm</tt>).  The basic Scheme code must
      be compiled to C using your system's CHICKEN compiler.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>% chicken example.scm -output-file oexample.c</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      So for the C mode of SWIG CHICKEN, <tt>example_wrap.c</tt> and
      <tt>oexample.c</tt> are the files that must be compiled to
      object files and linked into your project.
      </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn4"></a>17.1.2 Running SWIG in C++ mode</H3>


      <p>
      To run SWIG CHICKEN in C++ mode, use
      the -chicken -c++ option.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>% swig -chicken -c++ example.i</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      This will generate <tt>example_wrap.cxx</tt>,
      <tt>example.scm</tt>, <tt>example-generic.scm</tt> and
      <tt>example-clos.scm</tt>.  The basic Scheme code must be
      compiled to C using your system's CHICKEN compiler.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>% chicken example.scm -output-file oexample.c</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      So for the C++ mode of SWIG CHICKEN, <tt>example_wrap.cxx</tt>
      and <tt>oexample.c</tt> are the files that must be compiled to
      object files and linked into your project.

      </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn5"></a>17.2 Code Generation</H2>


<H3><a name="Chicken_nn6"></a>17.2.1 Naming Conventions</H3>


    <p>
      Given a C variable, function or constant declaration named
      <tt>Foo_Bar_to_Foo_Baz</tt>, the declaration will be available
      in CHICKEN as an identifier ending with
      <tt>Foo-Bar-&gt;Foo-Baz</tt>.  That is, an underscore is converted
      to a dash and '_to_' is converted to an arrow.

      <br>

      Additionally, there is a <em>mixed</em> mode that can be
      specified with the <tt>-mixed</tt> option on the SWIG command
      line.  In this mode, the above rules apply with the addition
      that changes in case are indications to SWIG CHICKEN to place a
      dash in the CHICKEN identifier and the name is converted to lowercase.
      For example, a C declartaion
      named <tt>someDeclaration_xyz</tt> will be available as the
      CHICKEN identifier ending with <tt>some-declaration-xyz</tt>.

      <br>

      You may control what the CHICKEN identifier will be by using the
      <tt>%rename</tt> SWIG directive in the SWIG interface file.
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn7"></a>17.2.2 Modules and Prefixes</H3>


    <p>
      SWIG CHICKEN does not use the standard CHICKEN module system
      (which has been deprecated); instead, it uses a prefix system.
      Specifying the module name as 'example' in SWIG CHICKEN can be
      done using either of:
    </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Placing <tt>%module example</tt> in the SWIG interface
	  file.</li>
	<li>Using <tt>-module example</tt> on the SWIG command
	  line.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      CHICKEN will be able to access the module using the <tt>(declare
	(uses <i>modulename</i>))</tt> CHICKEN Scheme form.

      <br>

      Normally, for a C declaration <tt>Foo_Bar</tt> with a module
      name of 'example', the corresponding CHICKEN identifier will be
      <tt>example:Foo-Bar</tt>.  <strong>The module name and a colon is
      prefixed to the CHICKEN identifier</strong> (following normal
      naming conventions).

      <br>

      You may explicitly override the prefix with the SWIG command
      line option <tt>-prefix <i>whateverprefix</i></tt>, or you may
      remove the prefix with the option <tt>-noprefix</tt>.

    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn8"></a>17.2.3 Constants and Variables</H3>


    <p>
      Constants may be created using any of the four constructs in
      the interface file:
    </p>
      <ol>
	<li><code>#define MYCONSTANT1 ...</code></li>
	<li><code>%constant int MYCONSTANT2 = ...</code></li>
	<li><code>const int MYCONSTANT3 = ...</code></li>
	<li><code>enum { MYCONSTANT4  = ... };</code></li>
      </ol>

    <p>
      In all cases, the constants may be accessed from with CHICKEN
      using the form <tt>(MYCONSTANT1)</tt>; that is, the constants
      may be accessed using the read-only parameter form.
    </p>

    <p>
      Variables are accessed using the full parameter form.
      For example, to set the C variable "int my_variable;", use the
      Scheme form <tt>(my-variable 2345)</tt>.  To get the C variable,
      use <tt>(my-variable)</tt>.
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn9"></a>17.2.4 Functions</H3>


    <p>
      C functions declared in the SWIG interface file will have
      corresponding CHICKEN Scheme procedures.  For example, the C
      function "int sqrt(double x);" will be available using the
      Scheme form <tt>(sqrt 2345.0)</tt>.  A <code>void</code> return
      value will give C_SCHEME_UNDEFINED as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
      A function may return more than one value by using the
      <code>OUTPUT</code> specifier (see Lib/chicken/typemaps.i).
      They will be returned as a Scheme list if there is more than one
      result (that is, a non-void return value and at least one argout
      parameter, or a void return value and at least two argout
      parameters).
    </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn10"></a>17.3 TinyCLOS</H2>


      <p>
      The author of TinyCLOS, Gregor Kiczales, describes TinyCLOS as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
	Tiny CLOS is a Scheme implementation of a `kernelized' CLOS, with a
	metaobject protocol. The implementation is even simpler than
	the simple CLOS found in `The Art of the Metaobject Protocol,'
	weighing in at around 850 lines of code, including (some)
	comments and documentation.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
      Almost all good Scheme books describe how to use metaobjects and
      generic procedures to implement an object-oriented Scheme
      system.  Please consult a Scheme book if you are unfamiliar
      with the concept.
      </p>

      <p>

      CHICKEN has a modified version of TinyCLOS, which SWIG CHICKEN
      uses in C++ mode.  SWIG CHICKEN generates a
      <tt>xxx-generic.scm</tt> and a <tt>xxx-clos.scm</tt> file, which
      contain TinyCLOS macros.  When using these macros, you will need
      to <tt>(include "xxx-generic")</tt> all the generic macros your
      program needs, and <strong>then</strong> <tt>(include
      "xxx-clos")</tt> all the metaobject (class) macros your program
      needs.
      </p>

      <p>

      SWIG CHICKEN will call the destructor for all TinyCLOS objects
      that are garbage-collected by CHICKEN.  It also allows access to
      the underlying low-level Scheme procedures with (de)-marshaling
      of any TinyCLOS parameters.  It is best to learn the TinyCLOS
      system by running the <tt>Examples/chicken/class/</tt> example.

      </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn11"></a>17.4 Compilation</H2>


    <p>
      Please refer to <em>CHICKEN - A practical and portable Scheme
      system - User's manual</em> for detailed help on how to compile
      C code for use in a CHICKEN program.  Briefly, to compile C
      code, be sure to add <tt>`chicken-config -cflags`</tt> or
      <tt>`chicken-config -shared -cflags`</tt> to your compiler
      options.  Use the <tt>-shared</tt> option if you want to create
      a dynamically loadable module.  You might also want to use the
      much simpler <tt>csc</tt> or <tt>csc.bat</tt>.
    </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn12"></a>17.5 Linkage</H2>


    <p>
      Please refer to <em>CHICKEN - A practical and portable Scheme
      system - User's manual</em> for detailed help on how to link
      object files to create a CHICKEN Scheme program.  Briefly, to
      link object files, be sure to add <tt>`chicken-config
      -extra-libs -libs`</tt> or <tt>`chicken-config -shared
      -extra-libs -libs`</tt>to your linker options.  Use the
      <tt>-shared</tt> option if you want to create a dynamically
      loadable module.
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn13"></a>17.5.1 Shared library</H3>


    <p>
      The easiest way to use SWIG and CHICKEN is to use the csc compiler
      wrapper provided by CHICKEN.  Assume you have a SWIG interface file
      in example.i and the C functions being wrapped are in example_impl.c.
    </p>

   <blockquote>
   <pre>
   $ swig -chicken example.i
   $ csc -svk example.scm example_impl.c example_wrap.c
   $ csi example.so test_script.scm
   </pre>
   </blockquote>

    <p>
      You must be careful not to name the example_impl.c file example.c because
      when compiling example.scm, csc compiles that into example.c!
    </p>

<H3><a name="Chicken_nn14"></a>17.5.2 Static binary</H3>


   <p>Again, we can easily use csc to build a binary.</p>

   <blockquote>
   <pre>
   $ swig -chicken example.i
   $ csc -vk example.scm example_impl.c example_wrap.c test_script.scm -o example
   $ ./example
   </pre>
   </blockquote>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn15"></a>17.6 Typemaps</H2>


    <p>
      The Chicken module handles all types via typemaps. This information is
      read from <code>Lib/chicken/typemaps.i</code> and
      <code>Lib/chicken/chicken.swg</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two Chicken-specific typemaps are supported:
      <code>clos_in</code> and <code>clos_out</code>.  They are for
      converting TinyCLOS to and from low-level CHICKEN SWIG.  Here is
      a quick example:
    </p>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>
/* Let "Shape" objects be converted back and forth from TinyCLOS into
   low-level CHICKEN SWIG procedures */

%typemap(clos_in) Shape * = SIMPLE_CLOS_OBJECT *;
%typemap(clos_out) Shape * = SIMPLE_CLOS_OBJECT *;
	</pre>
      </blockquote>

      The <code>SIMPLE_CLOS_OBJECT</code> will generally be all that
      is needed ... the definition of this is as follows:

      <blockquote>
	<pre>
/* TinyCLOS &lt;--&gt; Low-level CHICKEN */

%typemap("clos_in") SIMPLE_CLOS_OBJECT * "(slot-ref $input (quote this))"
%typemap("clos_out") SIMPLE_CLOS_OBJECT * "(make $class (quote this) $1)"
	</pre>
      </blockquote>

      Now, in the example using "Shape" objects, all objects
      instantiated from Shape or <em>any of its subclasses fully known
      to SWIG</em> will have correct TinyCLOS representations based on
      <code>SIMPLE_CLOS_OBJECT</code>.  SWIG "knows" the classes that
      are exposed in the SWIG interface file; it "fully knows" only
      those classes that are not forward declarations.

      <br>

      A real-world example of the "fully knows" problem is found in
      the VTK visualization library.  All VTK classes are derived from
      vtkObject.

      <blockquote>
	<pre>
   /* FILE: vtkObject.h */
   class vtkObject {
      // ...
   };
	</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>
   /* FILE: vtkWindow.h */
   #include "vtkObject.h"

   class vtkWindow : public vtkObject {
      // ...
   };
	</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>
   /* FILE: vtkViewport.h */
   #include "vtkViewport.h"

   class vtkViewport : public vtkObject {
      // ...
   };
	</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>
   /* FILE: vtkRenderWindow.h */
   #include "vtkWindow.h"

   class vtkRenderer;
   class vtkRenderWindow : public vtkWindow {
      // ...
      virtual void AddRenderer (vtkRenderer *rendererArg);
      // ...
   };
	</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>
   /* FILE: vtkRenderer.h */
   #include "vtkViewport.h"

   class vtkRenderWindow;
   class vtkRenderer : public vtkViewport {
      // ...
      void SetRenderWindow(vtkRenderWindow *);
      // ...
   };
	</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
	<pre>
   /* FILE: vtk.i; SWIG interface file */
   %typemap(clos_in) vtkObject * = SIMPLE_CLOS_OBJECT *;
   %typemap(clos_out) vtkObject * = SIMPLE_CLOS_OBJECT *;
   %include "vtkObject.h"
   %include "vtkWindow.h"
   %include "vtkViewport.h"
   %include "vtkRenderWindow.h"
   %include "vtkRenderer.h"
	</pre>
      </blockquote>

    <p>
    After SWIG processes <code>vtkObject.h</code> (from the
    <tt>%include "vtkObject.h"</tt> line), SWIG will have the complete
    definition of the <code>vtkObject</code> class because
    <code>vtkObject</code> does not contain any references to any
    other classes.  As it reads <code>vtkWindow.h</code> and
    <code>vtkViewport.h</code>, it will already have the definition of
    <code>vtkObject</code>, so it will not need a <code>clos_in</code>
    or <code>clos_out</code> typemap for the <code>vtkWindow</code> or
    <code>vtkViewport</code> subclasses of <code>vtkObject</code>.
    However, by the time SWIG gets to <tt>%include
    "vtkRenderWindow.h"</tt>, it will not have the definition for the
    <code>vtkRenderer</code> class, even though it is used by
    <code>vtkRenderWindow</code>.  We therefore <strong>must</strong>
    put in <code>clos_in/clos_out</code> typemaps for
    <code>vtkRenderer</code>.

    </p>

<H2><a name="Chicken_nn16"></a>17.7 Pointers</H2>


    <p>
      For pointer types, SWIG uses CHICKEN tagged pointers.

      A tagged pointer is an ordinary CHICKEN pointer with an
      extra slot for a void *.  With SWIG
      CHICKEN, this void * is a pointer to a type-info
      structure.  So each pointer used as input or output from
      the SWIG-generated CHICKEN wrappers will have type
      information attached to it.  This will let the wrappers
      correctly determine which method should be called
      according to the object type hierarchy exposed in the SWIG
      interface files.
    </p>
    <p>
      To construct a Scheme object from a C pointer, the wrapper code
      calls the function 
      <code>SWIG_NewPointerObj(void *ptr, swig_type_info *type, int owner)</code>,
      The function that calls <code>SWIG_NewPointerObj</code> must have a variable declared
      <code>C_word *known_space = C_alloc(C_SIZEOF_SWIG_POINTER);</code>
      It is ok to call <code>SWIG_NewPointerObj</code> more than once, 
      just make sure known_space has enough space for all the created pointers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the pointer represented by a CHICKEN tagged pointer, the
      wrapper code calls the function 
      <code>SWIG_ConvertPtr(C_word s, void **result, swig_type_info *type, int flags)</code>,
      passing a pointer to a struct representing the expected pointer
      type.
    </p>
