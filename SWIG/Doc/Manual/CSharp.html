The C# module has only recently been added to SWIG and is still in a state of development.
The C# module is very similar to the Java module, so until some documentation has been written,
please use the <a href="Java.html">Java documentation</a> as a guide to using SWIG with C#.

<p>
The directory Examples/csharp has a number of examples. 
If your SWIG installation went well Unix users should be able to type <tt>make</tt> in each example directory, 
then <tt>ilrun runme</tt> (pnet C# compiler) or <tt>mono runme</tt> (Mono C# compiler) to see them running.
Some project files will be added soon for use with the Microsoft .NET C# compiler.
