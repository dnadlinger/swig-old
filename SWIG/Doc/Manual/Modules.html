When first working with SWIG, users commonly start by creating a
single module.  That is, you might define a single SWIG interface that
wraps some set of C/C++ code.  You then compile all of the generated
wrapper code into a module and use it.   For large applications, however,
this approach is problematic---the size of the generated wrapper code
can be rather large.  Moreover, it is probably easier to manage the
target language interface when it is broken up into smaller pieces.

<p>
This chapter describes the problem of using SWIG in programs
where you want to create a collection of modules.

<a name="n2"></a><H2>14.1 The SWIG runtime code</H2>


Many of SWIG's target languages generate a set of functions
commonly known as the "SWIG runtime."   These functions are 
primarily related to the runtime type system which checks pointer
types and performs other tasks such as proper casting of pointer
values in C++. As a general rule, the statically typed target languages,
such as Java, use the language's built in static type checking and
have no need for a SWIG runtime. All the dynamically typed / interpreted
languages rely on the SWIG runtime.

<p>
By default, the runtime functions are private to each SWIG-generated
module.  That is, the runtime functions are declared with "static"
linkage and are visible only to the wrapper functions defined in that
module.  If two completely different SWIG modules are loaded, this
presents no problem---each module uses its own private runtime code.
The only problem with this approach is that when more than one SWIG
module is used in the same application, those modules often need to
share type information.  This is especially true for C++ programs
where SWIG must collect and share information about inheritance
relationships that cross module boundaries.

<p>
To solve the problem of sharing information across modules, the
SWIG runtime functions need to be exposed in a way that allows data to
be shared between modules. The next section describes how to do that.

<a name="n3"></a><H2>14.2 Compiling Multiple SWIG modules</H2>


Suppose that you have three SWIG interface files A.i, B.i, and C.i
and suppose that these modules interact with each other.  To make this work,
there are two approaches you can take:

<p>
<b>Option 1:</b> Designate one module to provide the runtime code

<p>
With this option, one of the modules is designated as providing the runtime
environment.   This is done with the <tt>-runtime</tt> option like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% swig -runtime -c++ -python A.i
</pre>
</blockquote>

The other modules are then compiled without runtime support.  This is done by
supplying the <tt>-noruntime</tt> option like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% swig -noruntime -c++ -python B.i
% swig -noruntime -c++ -python C.i
</pre>
</blockquote>

To use the modules, you compile and link everything as before, but you
need to make sure that module A is loaded before all of the other
modules are used---otherwise you will get unresolved symbols.

<p>
Now, the bad news:  This approach may or may not work depending on the platform you
are using, what target language you are using, and the way that shared libraries work
on the system.  On many systems, the symbols contained in dynamically loaded modules
are private.  Therefore, even though module A provides the runtime code, the other modules
won't be able to find it.   You'll know if this is the case if you try to load the other modules
and you get errors about unresolved SWIG_* functions.

<p>
<b>Option 2: Build a runtime library</b>

<p>
The second way to work with multiple modules is to create a special runtime library module.
To do this, you first need to create an empty SWIG interface file, say swigrun.i, containing
just the %module directive, for example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
%module swigrun
</pre>
</blockquote>

Next, build a runtime library like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% swig -runtime -python swigrun.i
% # Build a shared library --- this is different on every machine! (shown for Linux)
% gcc -fpic swigrun_wrap.c -o swigrun_wrap.o
% gcc -shared swigrun_wrap.o -o libswigrunpy.so
</pre>
</blockquote>


Now, you compile all of the normal SWIG modules using the <tt>-noruntime</tt> option:

<blockquote>
<pre>
% swig -noruntime -c++ -python A.i
% swig -noruntime -c++ -python B.i
% swig -noruntime -c++ -python C.i
</pre>
</blockquote>

Finally, when linking the dynamically loadable modules, you need to link again the special
runtime library above.  For example (Linux) :

<blockquote>
<pre>
% g++ -shared A_wrap.o -L. -lswigrunpy -o _A.so
% g++ -shared B_wrap.o -L. -lswigrunpy -o _B.so
% g++ -shared C_wrap.o -L. -lswigrunpy -o _C.so
</pre>
</blockquote>

Again, all of the details will vary depending on what compiler you use, the platform, target language,
and so forth.  The key point is that the runtime needs to be contained in a shared/dynamic library (DLL) and
you need to link all of the modules against that library.

<p>
When you use the modules created using this technique, the runtime code will be automatically loaded
when the modules are imported.  Moreover, since all of the modules are linked against the same runtime
library, they will share that code.

<a name="n4"></a><H2>14.3 A word of caution about static libraries</H2>


When working with multiple SWIG modules, you should take care not to use static
libraries.  For example, if you have a static library <tt>libfoo.a</tt> and you link a collection
of SWIG modules with that library, each module will get its own private copy of the library code inserted
into it. This is very often <b>NOT</b> what you want and it can lead to unexpected or bizarre program
behavior. When working with dynamically loadable modules, you should try to work exclusively with shared libaries.

<a name="n5"></a><H2>14.4 References</H2>


Due to the complexity of working with shared libraries and multiple modules, it might be a good idea to consult
an outside reference.  John Levine's "Linkers and Loaders" is highly recommended.

<a name="n6"></a><H2>14.5 Reducing the wrapper file size</H2>
Using multiple modules with the <tt>%import</tt> directive is the most common approach to modularising large projects.
In this way a number of different wrapper files can be generated, thereby avoiding the generation of a single large wrapper file.
There are a couple of alternative solutions for reducing the size of a wrapper file through the use of command line options.

<p/>
<b>-fcompact</b><br>
This command line option will compact the size of the wrapper file without changing the code generated into the wrapper file.
It simply removes blank lines and joins lines of code together.
This is useful for compilers that have a maximum file size that can be handled.

<p/>
<b>-fvirtual</b><br>
This command line option will remove the generation of superfluous virtual method wrappers.
Consider the following inheritance hierarchy:

<blockquote>
<pre>
struct Base {
  virtual void method();
  ...
};

struct Derived : Base {
  virtual void method();
  ...
};
</pre>
</blockquote>
Normally wrappers are generated for both methods, whereas this command line option will suppress the generation of a wrapper for <tt>Derived::method</tt>.
Normal polymorphic behaviour remains as <tt>Derived::method</tt> will still be called should you have
a <tt>Derived</tt> instance and call the wrapper for <tt>Base::method</tt>.
