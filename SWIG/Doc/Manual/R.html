<H1>SWIG and R</H1>

<p>
R is a GPL'ed open source statistical and plotting environment.
Information about R can be found at <a
href="http://www.r-project.org/">www.r-project.org</a>.

The R binding are under active development and are extremely
experimental.  Not all features have been implemented and the API is
not stable.
</p>

<H2>Bugs</H2>
<p>
Currently the following features are not implemented or broken:
<ul>
<li>Garbage collection of created objects
<li>C Array wrappings
<li>tested on UNIX only, how well or badly it works on windows is not known
</ul>

<H2>Using R and SWIG</H2>

<p>
To use R and SWIG in C mode, execute the following commands where
example_func.c is the name of the file with the functions in them
<div class="shell">
<pre>
swig -r -o example,c example.i
PKG_LIBS="example_func.c" R CMD SHLIB example.c
</pre>
</div>

The corresponding comments for C++ mode are
<div class="shell">
<pre>
swig -c++ -r -o example.cpp example.i
PKG_LIBS="example_func.cxx" R CMD SHLIB example.cpp
</pre>
</div>

Note that R is sensitive to the name of the file and to the file
extension in C and C++ mode.  The name of the wrapper file must be the
name of the library.  Also in C++ mode, the file extension must be cpp
rather than cxx for the R compile command to recognize it.
</p>

<p>
The commands produce two files.  A dynamic shared object file called
example.so and an R wrapper file called example_wrap.S.  To load these
files, start up R and type in the following commands
<div class="shell">
<pre>
dyn.load('example.so')
source('example_wrap.S')
</pre>
These two files can be loaded in any order
</p>

<h2>General policy</h2>
The general policy of the module is to treat the C/C++ as a basic
wrapping over the underlying functions and rely on the R type system
to provide R syntax.

<h2>Language conventions</h2>
getitem and setitem use C++ conventions (i.e. zero based indices). [<-
and [ are overloaded to allow for R syntax (one based indices and
slices)

<h2>C++ classes</h2>
C++ objects are implemented as external pointer objects with the class
being the mangled name of the class. The C++ classes are encapsulated
as an SEXP with an external pointer type. The class is the mangled
name of the class. The nice thing about R is that is allows you to
keep track of the pointer object which removes the necessity for a lot
of the proxy class baggage you see in other languages.

<h2>Enumerations</h2>
enumerations are characters which are then converted back and forth to
ints before calling the C routines. All of the enumeration code is
done in R.
