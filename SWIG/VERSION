# The variable `devrelease_today' is the version suffix "u-DATE-TIME".
# This ensures a version w/ second resolution, great for developers, but
# unnecessary for release.  The "u" is for "unstable".  For release,
# remove (or comment out) the `devrelease_today' component of var
# `SWIG_MINOR_VERSION', do "make dist", and then add `devrelease_today'
# back again.
