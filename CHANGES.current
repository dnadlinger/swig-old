	    %varargs when used with a numeric argument used to create an additional argument

            [D] Fixed wrapping of enums that are type char, for example:

	    Added preprocessor guards for python functions PyUnicode_AsWideChar and
	    PySlice_GetIndices, which changed signatures in python3.2.

2011-04-07: wsfulton
            Fix wrapping of const array typedefs which were generating uncompileable code as

2011-04-03: szager
	    Merged in the szager-python-builtin branch, adding the -builtin feature
	    for python.  The -builtin option may provide a significant performance gain
	    in python wrappers.  For full details and limitations, refer to Doc/Manual/Python.html.
	    A small test suite designed to demonstrate the performance gain is in
	    Examples/python/performance.

2011-04-01: wsfulton
            Add in missing wrappers for friend functions for some target languages, mostly
            the non-scripting languages like Java and C#.
