Version 1.3.34 (in progress)
============================

12/06/2007: wsfulton
	    Fix #1734415 - template template parameters with default arguments such as:

              template<typename t_item, template<typename> class t_alloc = pfc::alloc_fast >
                class list_t : public list_impl_t<t_item,pfc::array_t<t_item,t_alloc> > { ... };

12/04/2007: mgossage
	    [lua] Fix a bug in the class hierachy code, where the methods were not propagated, 
	    if the name ordering was in a certain order.
	    Added new example programs (dual, embed) and runtime tests for test-suite.

11/30/2007: wsfulton
	    Fix using statements using a base class method where the methods were overloaded.
            Depending on the order of the using statements and method declarations, these
            were previously generating uncompileable wrappers, eg:

              struct Derived : Base {
                virtual void funk();
                using Base::funk;
              };
