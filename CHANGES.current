	    [PHP] The default out typemap for char[ANY] now returns the string up to a
	    zero byte, or the end of the array if there is no zero byte.  This
	    is the same as Python does, and seems more generally useful than
	    the previous behaviour of returning the whole contents of the array
	    including any zero bytes.  If you want the old behaviour, you can provide
	    your own typemap to do this:

	    %typemap(out) char [ANY]
	    %{
		RETVAL_STRINGL($1, $1_dim0, 1);
	    %}
