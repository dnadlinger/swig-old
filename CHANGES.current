	    [lua] Fix a bug in the class hierachy code, where the methods were not propagated,

	    Fix using statements using a base class method where the methods were overloaded.
            Depending on the order of the using statements and method declarations, these
            were previously generating uncompileable wrappers, eg:

              struct Derived : Base {
                virtual void funk();
                using Base::funk;
              };
