	    [Python] Commit patch #2089149: Director exception handling mangles
	    returned exception.  Exceptions raised by Python code in directors
	    are now passed through to the caller without change.  Also, remove
	    the ": " prefix which used to be added to other director exceptions
	    (eg, those due to incorrect return types).

            [C#] Support for 'using' and 'fixed' blocks in the 'csin' typemap is now
            possible through the use of the pre attribute and the new terminator attribute, eg

              %typemap(csin, 
                       pre="    using (CDate temp$csinput = new CDate($csinput)) {",
                       terminator="    } // terminate temp$csinput using block",
                      ) const CDate &
                       "$csclassname.getCPtr(temp$csinput)"

            See CSharp.html for more info.
