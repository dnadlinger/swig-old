Version 2.0.2 (in progress)
===========================

2010-01-17: wsfulton
            New warning for smart pointers if only some of the classes in the inheritance
            chain are marked as smart pointer, eg, %shared_ptr should be used for all classes
            in an inheritance hierarchy, so this new warning highlights code where this is
            not the case.

              example.i:12: Warning 520: Base class 'A' of 'B' is not similarly marked as a smart pointer.
              example.i:16: Warning 520: Derived class 'C' of 'B' is not similarly marked as a smart pointer.

2010-01-14: wsfulton
            Added some missing multi-argument typemaps: (char *STRING, size_t LENGTH) and 
            (char *STRING, int LENGTH). Documentation for this updated. Java patch from
            Volker Grabsch.

2010-12-30: klickverbot
            [C#, D, Java] Check for collision of parameter names with target
            language keywords when generating the director glue code.
            
            The situation in which the generated could would previously be
            invalid is illustrated in the new 'director_keywords' test case.

2010-12-23: wsfulton
            [C#] Fix $csinput special variable not being expanded for csvarin typemaps
            when used for global variables. Reported by Vadim Zeitlin.

2010-12-14: wsfulton
            Fix $basemangle expansion in array typemaps. For example if type is int *[3],
            $basemangle expands to _p_int.

2010-12-07: iant
	    Check that we are using a sufficiently new version of the
	    6g or 8g Go compiler during configure time. If not, disable Go.
            Minimum version is now 6707.

	    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2010-12-06: wsfulton
            Fix #3127394 - use of network paths on Windows/MSys.

2010-11-18: klickverbot
	    [D] Added the D language module.

2010-11-12: vadz
	    Fix handling of multiple regex-using %renames attached to the same
	    declaration. For example, now

	      %rename("%(regex/^Set(.*)/put\\1/)s") "";
	      %rename("%(regex/^Get(.*)/get\\1/)s") "";

	    works as expected whereas before only the last anonymous rename was
	    taken into account.

2010-10-17: drjoe
	    [R] Fix failure in overloaded functions which was breaking
	    QuantLib-SWIG

2010-10-14: olly
	    [PHP] Allow compilation on non-conforming Microsoft C++ compilers
	    which don't accept: return function_returning_void();
	    Reported by Frank Vanden Berghen on the SWIG mailing list.

2010-10-12: wsfulton
            Fix unary scope operator (::) (global scope) regression introduced in 2.0.0, reported by
            Ben Walker. The mangled symbol names were incorrect, sometimes resulting in types being
            incorrectly treated as opaque types.
