Version 1.3.32 (in progress)
============================

01/03/2007: beazley
            [Internals].  Use of swigkeys.c/.h variables is revoked.  Please use
            simple strings for attribute names.

12/30/2006: beazley
            Internal API functions HashGetAttr() and HashCheckAttr() have been revoked.
            Please use Getattr() to retrieve attributes.  The function Checkattr() can
            be used to check attributes.  Note:  These functions have been revoked 
            because they only added a marginal performance improvement at the expense
            code clarity. 

12/26/2006: mgossage
            [Lua] Added more STL (more exceptions, map, size_t),
