===========================

2011-03-17: wsfulton
	    Fix regression introduced in swig-2.0.2 where filenames with spaces were not found
	    when used with %include and %import. Reported by Shane Liesegang.

2011-03-15: wsfulton
	    [UTL] Fix overloading when using const char[], problem reported by David Maxwell.
            Similarly for char[ANY] and const char[ANY].

2011-03-15: wsfulton
	    [C#] Apply patch #3212624 fixing std::map Keys property.

2011-03-14: olly
	    [PHP] Fix handling of overloaded methods/functions where some
	    return void and others don't - whether this worked or not depended
	    on the order they were encountered in (SF#3208299).
	
2011-03-13: klickverbot
            [D] Extended support for C++ namespaces (nspace feature).

	    modules (SF#3202463).

	    [Python] Fix SF #3194294 - corner case bug when 'NULL' is used as the default value
            for a primitive type parameter in a method declaration.

2011-03-07: olly
	    [PHP] Don't use zend_error_noreturn() for cases where the function
	    returns void - now this issue can only matter if you have a function
	    or method which is directed and returns non-void.

2011-03-06: olly
	    [PHP] Add casts to the typemaps for long long and unsigned long
	    long to avoid issues when they are used with shorter types via
	    %apply.

2011-03-02: wsfulton
	    Templated smart pointers overloaded with both const and non const operator-> generated uncompilable
	    code when the pointee was a class with either public member variables or static methods.
	    Regression in 2.0.x reported as working in 1.3.40 by xantares on swig-user mailing list.
