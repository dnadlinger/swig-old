Version 2.0.1 (in progress)
===========================

2010-07-16: wsfulton
            Fix wrapping of function pointers and member function pointers when the function
            returns by reference.

2010-07-13: vadz
            Add "regexmatch", "regextarget" and "notregexmatch" which can be
            used to apply %rename directives to the declarations matching the
            specified regular expression only. The first two can be used
            interchangeably, both of the %renames below do the same thing:

                %rename("$ignore", regexmatch$name="Old$") "";
                %rename("$ignore", regextarget=1) "Old$";

            (namely ignore the declarations having "Old" suffix).

            "notregexmatch" restricts the match to only the declarations which
            do not match the regular expression, e.g. here is how to rename to
            lower case versions all declarations except those consisting from
            capital letters only:

                %rename("$(lower)s", notregexmatch$name="^[A-Z]+$") "";

2010-07-13: vadz
            Add the new "regex" encoder that can be used in %rename, e.g.

                %rename("regex:/(\\w+)_(.*)/\\2/") "";

            to remove any alphabetical prefix from all identifiers. The syntax
            of the regular expressions is Perl-like and PCRE library
            (http://www.pcre.org/) is used to implement this feature but notice
            that backslashes need to be escaped as usual inside C strings.

            Original patch from Torsten Landschoff.

2010-07-08: wsfulton
            Fix #3024875 - shared_ptr of classes with non-public destructors. This also fixes
            the "unref" feature when used on classes with non-public destructors.

2010-06-10: wsfulton
            [Lua] Fix SWIG_lua_isnilstring multiply defined when using multiple
            modules and wrapping strings. Patch from 'Number Cruncher'.

2010-06-10: olly
	    [PHP] Fix directors to correctly call a method with has a
	    different name in PHP to C++ (we were always using the C++ name
	    in this case).

2010-06-03: wsfulton
            Fix uncompileable code when %rename results in two enum items
            with the same name. Reported by Vadim Zeitlin.
