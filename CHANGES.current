Version 2.0.1 (in progress)
===========================

2010-08-17: wsfulton
            Fix make distclean when some of the more obscure languages are detected by
            configure - fixes from Torsten Landschoff.

2010-07-28: wsfulton
            Restore configuring out of source for the test-suite since it broke in 1.3.37.
            As previously, if running 'make check-test-suite' out of source, it needs to be
            done by invoking configure with a relative path. Invoking configure with an
            absolute path will not work. Running the full 'make check' still needs to be
            done in the source tree.

2010-07-16: wsfulton
            Fix wrapping of function pointers and member function pointers when the function
            returns by reference.

2010-07-13: vadz
            Removed support for the old experimental "rxspencer" encoder and
            "[not]rxsmatch" in %rename (see the 01/16/2006 entry). The new and
            officially supported "regex" encoder and "[not]regexmatch" checks
            should be used instead (see the two previous entries). Please
            replace "%(rxspencer:[pat][subst])s" with "%(regex:/pat/subst/)s"
            when upgrading. Notice that you will also need to replace the back-
            references of form "@1" with the more standard "\\1" and may need to
            adjust your regular expressions syntax as the new regex encoder uses
            Perl-compatible syntax and not (extended) POSIX syntax as the old one.

	    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2010-07-13: vadz
            Add "regexmatch", "regextarget" and "notregexmatch" which can be
            used to apply %rename directives to the declarations matching the
            specified regular expression only. The first two can be used
            interchangeably, both of the %renames below do the same thing:

                %rename("$ignore", regexmatch$name="Old$") "";
                %rename("$ignore", regextarget=1) "Old$";

            (namely ignore the declarations having "Old" suffix).

            "notregexmatch" restricts the match to only the declarations which
            do not match the regular expression, e.g. here is how to rename to
            lower case versions all declarations except those consisting from
            capital letters only:

                %rename("$(lowercase)s", notregexmatch$name="^[A-Z]+$") "";

2010-07-13: vadz
            Add the new "regex" encoder that can be used in %rename, e.g.

                %rename("regex:/(\\w+)_(.*)/\\2/") "";

            to remove any alphabetical prefix from all identifiers. The syntax
            of the regular expressions is Perl-like and PCRE library
            (http://www.pcre.org/) is used to implement this feature but notice
            that backslashes need to be escaped as usual inside C strings.

            Original patch from Torsten Landschoff.

2010-07-08: wsfulton
            Fix #3024875 - shared_ptr of classes with non-public destructors. This also fixes
            the "unref" feature when used on classes with non-public destructors.

2010-06-10: wsfulton
            [Lua] Fix SWIG_lua_isnilstring multiply defined when using multiple
            modules and wrapping strings. Patch from 'Number Cruncher'.

2010-06-10: olly
	    [PHP] Fix directors to correctly call a method with has a
	    different name in PHP to C++ (we were always using the C++ name
	    in this case).

2010-06-03: wsfulton
            Fix uncompileable code when %rename results in two enum items
            with the same name. Reported by Vadim Zeitlin.
