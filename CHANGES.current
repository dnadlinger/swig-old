Version 2.0.2 (in progress)
===========================

2011-02-19: wsfulton
	    [PHP] Add missing INPUT, OUTPUT and INOUT typemaps in the typemaps.i library
            for primitive reference types as well as signed char * and bool *.

2011-02-19: olly
	    [PHP] Address bug in PHP on some platforms/architectures which
	    results in zend_error_noreturn() not being available using
	    SWIG_ZEND_ERROR_NORETURN which defaults to zend_error_noreturn but
	    can be overridden when building the module by passing
	    -DSWIG_ZEND_ERROR_NORETURN=zend_error to the compiler.  This may
	    result in compiler warnings, but should at least allow a module
	    to be built on those platforms/architectures (SF#3166423).

2011-02-18: wsfulton
            Fix #3184549 - vararg functions and function overloading when using the -fastdispatch option.

2011-02-18: olly
	    [PHP] An overloaded method which can return an object or a
	    primitive type no longer causes SWIG to segfault.  Reported by Paul
	    Colby in SF#3168531.

2011-02-18: olly
	    [PHP] Fix invalid erase during iteration of std::map in generated
	    director code.  Reported by Cory Bennett in SF#3175820.

2011-02-17: wsfulton
            Preprocessing now warns if extra tokens appear after #else and #end.

2011-02-16: wsfulton
            Fix #1653092 Preprocessor does not error out when #elif is missing an expression.
            This and other cases of missing preprocessor expressions now result in an error.

2011-02-14: wsfulton
            [Ocaml] Apply patch #3151788 from Joel Reymont. Brings Ocaml support a up to date 
            (ver 3.11 and 3.12), including std::string.

2011-02-13: wsfulton
            [Ruby] Apply patch #3176274 from James Masters - typecheck typemap for time_t.

2011-02-13: wsfulton
            Apply patch #3171793 from szager - protected director methods failing when -fvirtual is used.

2011-02-13: wsfulton
            Fix #1927852 - #include directives don't preprocess the file passed to it. The fix is for
            #include with -importall or -includeall, %include and %import, for example:
              #define FILENAME "abc.h"
              %include FILENAME

2011-02-12: wsfulton
            Fix #1940536, overactive preprocessor which was expanding defined(...) outside of #if and #elif
            preprocessor directives.

2011-02-05: wsfulton
            [MzScheme] SF #2942899 Add user supplied documentation to help getting started with MzScheme.
            Update chapter name to MzScheme/Racket accounting for the rename of MzScheme to Racket.

2011-02-05: wsfulton
            [C#] SF #3085906 - Possible fix running test-suite on Mac OSX.

2011-02-05: wsfulton
            SF #3173367 Better information during configure about Boost prerequisite for running
            the test-suite.

2011-02-05: wsfulton
            SF #3127633 Fix infinite loop in recursive typedef resolution.

2011-02-04: wsfulton
            [R] SF #3168676 Fix %rename not working for member variables and methods.

2011-02-04: wsfulton
            [clisp] SF #3148200 Fix segfault parsing nested unions.

2011-02-01: wsfulton
            [C#] Directors - a call to a method being defined in the base class, not
            overridden in a subclass, but again overridden in a class derived from
            the first subclass was not being dispatched correctly to the most derived class.
            See director_alternating.i for an example.

2011-02-01: wsfulton
            [C#, Java] Any 'using' statements in the protected section of a class were previously
            ignored with director protected (dirprot) mode.

2011-01-30: wsfulton
            Fix overloading with const pointer reference (SWIGTYPE *const&) parameters for a
            number of scripting languages.

2011-01-17: wsfulton
            New warning for smart pointers if only some of the classes in the inheritance
            chain are marked as smart pointer, eg, %shared_ptr should be used for all classes
            in an inheritance hierarchy, so this new warning highlights code where this is
            not the case.

              example.i:12: Warning 520: Base class 'A' of 'B' is not similarly marked as a smart pointer.
              example.i:16: Warning 520: Derived class 'C' of 'B' is not similarly marked as a smart pointer.

2011-01-14: wsfulton
            Added some missing multi-argument typemaps: (char *STRING, size_t LENGTH) and 
            (char *STRING, int LENGTH). Documentation for this updated. Java patch from
            Volker Grabsch.

2011-01-11: iant
	    Require Go version 7077 or later.

2010-12-30: klickverbot
            [C#, D, Java] Check for collision of parameter names with target
            language keywords when generating the director glue code.
            
            The situation in which the generated could would previously be
            invalid is illustrated in the new 'director_keywords' test case.

2010-12-23: wsfulton
            [C#] Fix $csinput special variable not being expanded for csvarin typemaps
            when used for global variables. Reported by Vadim Zeitlin.

2010-12-14: wsfulton
            Fix $basemangle expansion in array typemaps. For example if type is int *[3],
            $basemangle expands to _p_int.

2010-12-07: iant
	    Check that we are using a sufficiently new version of the
	    6g or 8g Go compiler during configure time. If not, disable Go.
            Minimum version is now 6707.

	    *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

2010-12-06: wsfulton
            Fix #3127394 - use of network paths on Windows/MSys.

2010-11-18: klickverbot
	    [D] Added the D language module.

2010-11-12: vadz
	    Fix handling of multiple regex-using %renames attached to the same
	    declaration. For example, now

	      %rename("%(regex/^Set(.*)/put\\1/)s") "";
	      %rename("%(regex/^Get(.*)/get\\1/)s") "";

	    works as expected whereas before only the last anonymous rename was
	    taken into account.

2010-10-17: drjoe
	    [R] Fix failure in overloaded functions which was breaking
	    QuantLib-SWIG

2010-10-14: olly
	    [PHP] Allow compilation on non-conforming Microsoft C++ compilers
	    which don't accept: return function_returning_void();
	    Reported by Frank Vanden Berghen on the SWIG mailing list.

2010-10-12: wsfulton
            Fix unary scope operator (::) (global scope) regression introduced in 2.0.0, reported by
            Ben Walker. The mangled symbol names were incorrect, sometimes resulting in types being
            incorrectly treated as opaque types.

            Also fixes #2958781 and some other type problems due to better typedef resolution, eg 
            std::vector<T *>::value_type didn't resolve to T * when it should have. The mangled type
            was incorrectly SWIGTYPE_std__vectorT_Test_p_std__allocatorT_Test_p_t_t__value_type and now
            it is correctly SWIGTYPE_p_Test.
