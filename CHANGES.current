Version 1.3.40 (in progress)
============================

	    [Java, C#] Add the 'notderived' attribute to the javabase and csbase typemaps.
	    When this attribute is set, the typemap will not apply to classes that are derived
	    from a C++ base class, eg 
	      %typemap(csbase, notderived="1") SWIGTYPE "CommonBase"

	    [Python] Don't attempt to acquire the GIL in situations where we
	    know that it will already be locked.  This avoids some dead-locks
	    with mod_python (due to mod_python bugs which are apparently
	    unlikely to ever be fixed), and results in smaller wrappers which
	    run a little faster (in tests with Xapian on x86-64 Ubuntu 9.04,
	    the stripped wrapper library was 11% smaller and ran 2.7% faster).

	    [C#] Fix #2753469 - bool &OUTPUT and bool *OUTPUT typemaps initialisation.

	    Fix #2746858 - C macro expression using floating point numbers

	    [PHP] The default out typemap for char[ANY] now returns the string up to a
	    zero byte, or the end of the array if there is no zero byte.  This
	    is the same as Python does, and seems more generally useful than
	    the previous behaviour of returning the whole contents of the array
	    including any zero bytes.  If you want the old behaviour, you can provide
	    your own typemap to do this:

	    %typemap(out) char [ANY]
	    %{
		RETVAL_STRINGL($1, $1_dim0, 1);
	    %}
