2010-10-12: wsfulton
            Fix unary scope operator (::) (global scope) regression introduced in 2.0.0, reported by
            Ben Walker. The mangled symbol names were incorrect, sometimes resulting in types being
            incorrectly treated as opaque types.

            Fails the configure if cannot find a yacc implementation
            (like bison)
