Version 1.3.37 (in progress)
=============================

2008-09-12: bhy
            [Python] Python 3.0 support branch merged into SWIG trunk. Thanks
            Google Summer of Code 2008 for support this project! By default
            SWIG will generate interface files compatible with both Python 2.x
            and 3.0. And there's also some Python 3 new features could be
            enabled by passing a "-py3" command line option to SWIG. These
            features are:

              - Function annotation support
                  Also, the parameter list of proxy function will be generated,
                  even without the "-py3" option. However, the parameter list
                  will fallback to *args if the function (or method) is overloaded.
              - Buffer interface support
              - Abstract base class support

            For details of Python 3 support and these features, please see the
            "Python 3 Support" section in the "SWIG and Python" chapter of SWIG
            documentation.

            The "-apply" command line option and support of generating codes
            using apply() is removed. Since this is only required by very old
            Python.

            This merge also patched SWIG's parser to solve a bug. By this patch,
            SWIG features able to be correctly applied on C++ conversion operator,
            such like this:
              
              %feature("shadow")  *::operator bool %{ ... %}

	    [Python] Commit patch #2089149: Director exception handling mangles
	    returned exception.  Exceptions raised by Python code in directors
	    are now passed through to the caller without change.  Also, remove
	    the ": " prefix which used to be added to other director exceptions
	    (eg, those due to incorrect return types).

            [C#] Support for 'using' and 'fixed' blocks in the 'csin' typemap is now
            possible through the use of the pre attribute and the new terminator attribute, eg

              %typemap(csin, 
                       pre="    using (CDate temp$csinput = new CDate($csinput)) {",
                       terminator="    } // terminate temp$csinput using block",
                      ) const CDate &
                       "$csclassname.getCPtr(temp$csinput)"

            See CSharp.html for more info.

	    [PHP] For std_vector.i and std_map.i, rename empty() to is_empty()

	    Patch from Richard Boulton in SF#2008229, plus follow-up patches
	    from Richard and Haoyu Bai.
