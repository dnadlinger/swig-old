Tagline: SWIG is a compiler that integrates C, C++, and Objective-C
         with scripting languages including Perl, Python, and Tcl.

This distribution represents work in progress towards building a new
SWIG release.  The guilty parties working on this are:

  -  Dave Beazley (beazley@cs.uchicago.edu)             (SWIG core)
  -  Dustin Mitchell (djmitche@cs.uchicago.edu)         (SWIG core)
  -  Loic Dachary (loic@ceic.com)                       (Perl5)
  -  Harco de Hilster (Harco.de.Hilster@ATComputing.nl) (Java)

General overview:
=================
The primary goal of future development is to make SWIG more modular,
extensible, and easier to maintain.  To this end, the source code has
been consolidated and reorganized with the Source directory.  Within
this directory, there are a number of different components:

      SWIG1.1       - These two directories contain the C++ code
      Modules1.1      corresponding to the SWIG1.1.x series of 
                      releases.  This code is still in use but is
                      slowly being deprecated.

*** Important note: ALL future SWIG development is taking place
in ANSI C.  Please avoid C++ if it all possible. -- Dave ***

      DOH           - Object framework for the ANSI C core.
      Core          - New SWIG core (ANSI C)
      Preprocessor  - SWIG preprocessor module
      Dustin        - Some Python stuff Dustin is working on.

Documentation for these components is weak or non-existent at this
time. However, this should only matter if you are actually hacking
on SWIG itself. Please bear with us.

Installation
============
It should be relatively simple.  Simply type the following:

     % ./configure
     % make
     % make install
     
If you checked the code out via CVS, you will have to run autoconf
before typing 'configure.'  In addition, a full build of SWIG requires
the use bison or yacc.

Participate!
============
We are looking for people who want to join the effort of getting this
next release off the ground.  Please send me email for details.
